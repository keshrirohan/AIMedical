{"question": "what is orgasm?", "patient_answer": "An orgasm, also known as a sexual climax, is a pleasurable physical, psychological or emotional response to prolonged sexual stimulation. It is often accompanied by a notable physiological reaction, such as ejaculation, blushing or spasm and may be followed by aftershocks.\n\nDictionaries still give the subsidiary meaning, \"a similar point of intensity of emotional excitement,\" but as of 2005 this usage has become obscure. It can be startling to modern readers when encountered in older literature.\n\n\nGeneral\nBoth males and females can experience orgasm, but the exact response varies across gender. Generally speaking, orgasm is the third stage of four in the human sexual response cycle, which is the currently accepted model of the physiological process of sexual stimulation", "doctor_answer": "You asked two questions that you might think are the same; but they are not. Orgasm is an experience resulting from the combined effects of physical stimulation, emotional bonding, intellectual intimacy and total surrender or giving to the experience of the moment that crest or climax in overwhelming sensual and spiritual thunderclaps.\n\nMany concepts may play a role in building orgasm, including thinking about making a baby, dominance and submission, etc.\n\nTrue love might be a component of a good orgasm, but is itself different and in the long term more fundamental than the orgasm. Having orgasms with someone you love is wonderful, but the existence of the orgasms does not in and of itself serve to indicate whether the relationship will endure over a long term."}

Medical treatments for sciatica, including medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral steroids, or epidural steroid injections to help relieve the inflammation, which is usually a component of the pain. Surgery for sciatica, such as microdiscectomy or lumbar laminectomy and discectomy, to remove the portion of the disc that is irritating the nerve root. This surgery is designed to help relieve both the pressure and inflammation and may be warranted if the sciatic nerve pain is severe and has not been relieved with appropriate manual or medical treatments.", "doctor_answer": "Surgery and meds are the last option IMO! \n\nThe first thing to do is determine the cause and to see if it is true sciatica.

{"question": "Can drinking to many diet cokes cause an ulcer?", "patient_answer": "It sure can - read this... it tells you what else can cause ulcers and explains what an ulcer is.  My uncle had to stop soda altogether because of this (good luck!):\n\nAn ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. \n\nThere are two main types of ulcers- \n\nPeptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. \n\nDuodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. \n\nHow do you know if you have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. \n\nIntense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. \n\nThere may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. \n\nThere are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium \"H. pylori\" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. \n\nSome medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding. \n\nTense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. \"The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide\" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. \n\nAlthough uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. \n\n\n\nWhen a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage. \n\nIf you find the above mentioned symptoms, contact the doctor. Immediate medical attention should be given if the patient is vomiting blood, has cold skin accompanied by sweating, faintness, weakness, or is experiencing extreme pain. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for prompt healing and also to prevent the ulcer from coming back. \n\nThe above is provided for your information, but you are responsible for your own actions to deal with your ulcers or gastro esophageal health problems.

{"question": "Would you categorize Bulimia Nervosa with Heroin addiction?  Why?", "patient_answer": "I'm with Scorpio on this one.  Addiction is defined as the compulsive need for and use of something that is psychologically or physically habit-forming, characterized by tolerance and by well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal; Being abnormally tolerant to and dependent upon a habit forming substance (such as the endorphins caused by throwing up, or the habit forming behavior of bingeing and the fear of gaining weight that leads to purging/laxatives/exercise in bulimia).\n\nWhat matters most is whether or not the substance or behavior causes what we now know to be the essence of addiction: uncontrollable, compulsive drug craving, seeking, and use, even in the face of negative health and social consequences.\n\nAddicts are trapped in their behaviors and cannot simply quit on their own. They have an illness that requires biomedical treatment. People often assume that because addiction begins with a voluntary behavior and is expressed in the form of excess behavior, an addict should just be able to quit by force of will alone. However, it is essential to understand when dealing with addicts that we are dealing with individuals whose brains have been altered by alcohol, drug or behavioral abuse. They need addiction treatment.\n\nToday, scientists and physicians overwhelmingly agree that while use and even abuse of drugs such as alcohol and cocaine is a behavior over which the individual exerts control, addiction to these substances is something different. Scientists have begun to understand why addicted people may sacrifice everything that's important to them -- their jobs, their families, their homes -- in the quest for a fix.\n\nBest,\n\n`k.", "doctor_answer": "I happen to agree with your friend. I've had my share of both bulimia and other addictions, and I classify all of them as \"coping mechanisms\" and \"distraction tools\".

Unfortunately there is no way to protect yourself 100% from HPV, although the risk is reduced if a condom is used.  HPV can be active in the skin, even though there are no warts present.  This means that you (or your partner) can have the virus and not even know it.  It stands to reason then, that HPV is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections.  My family doctor told me to just assume that everyone who has had more than 2 sexual partners in his/her lifetime has it.\n\nUPDATE: Based on later answers, I wanted to address mutual m*sterbation.  You CAN get HPV from mutual mast.  HPV warts can be microscopic, invisible to the naked eye.

{"question": "What is a heart murmur?", "patient_answer": "I personally was diagnosed with one a few years ago was sent to a cardiologist who said it was nothing to worry about it.  Since then, it was not detected when I had physicals.  I know many people who were diagnosed with them and they were nothing.\n\nHere's some info from webmd:\n\n\nIn particular, they occur in many healthy children, who may or may not outgrow them as adults. They may also occur during pregnancy. Such murmurs are called \"innocent\" heart murmurs. They are not associated with medical or heart conditions, and do not require treatment or lifestyle changes.\n\n\nThough many murmurs are innocent, some may indicate serious heart problems. For instance, heart murmurs may be caused by blood flowing through a heart valve made leaky or narrow by disease. Murmurs can also be caused by increased blood flow across a valve as a result of medical conditions such as anemia or hypothyroidism. Congenital cardiac defects (heart problems present at birth) can also cause heart murmurs. These often can be repaired with surgery.\n\nWithin the heart there are four chambers separated from each other by valves, or flaps, that regulate how much blood enters each chamber at any time. Healthy valves also help prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction in your heart.\n\nA healthy heart makes a \"lub-dub\" sound as it beats. The \"lub\" (systolic sound) happens when part of the heart contracts and the mitral and tricuspid valves close, and the \"dub\" (diastolic sound) occurs when part of the heart relaxes and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. A heart murmur is an extra sound, such as a whooshing, in the heartbeat caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves.\n\nHeart murmurs can be heard through a stethoscope and often are detected during routine physical examinations. On further examination, your doctor may find that the heart murmur is innocent. If your heart murmur is related to more serious heart problems, your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist). Medication or surgery may be recommended to treat the underlying problem. He or she may also suggest that you take extra precautions against getting a heart infection, such as by taking antibiotics when you have dental work or some surgeries. With thorough examination and proper tests, your doctor should be able to tell what causes your heart murmur.\n\nSymptoms\nMany people with heart murmurs experience no symptoms. However, some murmurs can occur in conjunction with these other symptoms:\n\n    * Chest pain\n    * Rapid heartbeat (palpitations)\n    * Breathlessness\n    * Fatigue\n    * Bluish skin color or fingertips (sometimes seen in babies with congenital heart defects)", "doctor_answer": "it is a hole in the heart"}
{"question": "What are some non-expensive ways to get rid of a cold?", "patient_answer": "home made chicken soup", "doctor_answer": "Although it's a bit late now, the cheapest means of getting over a cold is a healthy diet, regular exercise, and a reduction of stress in your lifestyle. That's the best way to PREVENT the cold to begin with, making it the cheapest overall remedy.\n\nHere's something interesting: once you're showing the symptoms of a cold (sneezing, body aches, runny nose, etc.) you've already HAD the cold and your body is casting off the byproducts of the virus.\n\nAnd, because a cold is based in a virus, you don't really catch the same cold again. Your body adapts to that viral strain. If you catch another cold right after you just get over your last one, it's a new cold and you came down with it because your immune system was already depressed from the most recent one."}
{"question": "HOW DO U GET RID OF ACNE?", "patient_answer": "DISCLAIMER: Before using any medicines, you should consult a registered physiscian. This is only for information.\n\nAcne Treatment\n\n|Self-Care at Home|\n\n    * Wash once or twice daily with soap and water to remove excess oil from the skin. An acne cleanser purchased over-the-counter in any drug store can also be helpful. Avoid scrubbing too abrasively because this can actually irritate the skin and cause acne to worsen.\n\n    * Over-the-counter acne medications can be used either at bedtime or during the day. Always follow the directions on any acne product.\n\n    * Many cover-up products are available without a prescription to improve the appearance of blemishes while they have a chance to heal. Most work well and should not worsen acne.\n\n    * Some cosmetics and other skin care products, however, can cause acne to worsen. Look for make-up, cosmetics, and skin care products labeled with the word noncomedogenic. This means that it does not cause or worsen acne.\n\n|Medical Treatment|\n\nMany treatment options are available to treat all forms of acne. Medications are the main treatment for acne and usually work well. Several preparations are available over-the-counter, while others require a prescription from a doctor.\n\n    * Over-the-counter medications: Nonprescription or over-the-counter medications for acne are plentiful and can be effective for milder forms of acne. They come in the form of soaps, washes, and cleansers.\n\n          o Many contain benzoyl peroxide, which does two things. First, benzoyl peroxide kills the acne-causing bacteria, which are thought to play a role in acne. Second, benzoyl peroxide can cause drying and flaking off of skin, which can help prevent the pores from becoming plugged. Plugged pores can develop into acne blemishes.\n\n          o Scrubbing excessively with any over-the-counter preparation can actually cause acne to worsen by additionally irritating the hair follicles.\n\n    * Prescription medications: Doctors can prescribe medications when acne becomes moderate to severe or is not controlled by over-the-counter medications. Prescription drugs can be used effectively alone or in combination with other prescription and nonprescription medications.\n\n          o Antibiotics: Antibiotics can be effective in treating most inflammatory acne (papules and pustules). They work by killing the bacteria and also by decreasing the redness and swelling seen in the inflammatory forms of acne.\n\n                + Antibiotics may be applied to the skin in the form of gels and lotions, or by way of pills. We now know that using a combination of 2 medications together may be very effective in treating acne. Using a topical antibiotic with topical benzoyl peroxide, for example, may prevent bacterial resistance to the antibiotic. Giving an antibiotic by mouth is often needed for acne that is more extensive, red, and tender.\n\n                + Antibiotics taken by mouth can be associated with more side effects than if applied to the skin and may interact with other medicines such as birth control pills. Sensitivity to the sun can result in a \"bad sunburn\" in some people who take the antibiotic tetracycline by mouth.\n\n          o Retinoids: Medicines made from vitamin A (retinoids) are useful in treating several types of acne lesions. Topical retinoids are effective in treating the noninflammatory types of acne (blackheads and whiteheads).\n\n                + Topical retinoids (applied directly to the skin) help to open clogged pores by creating a mild peeling effect. Drying of the skin can be a frequent side effect. Oral retinoids are reserved for treating the more extensive nodular type of acne or severe inflammatory acne, which has not responded to other treatments. Oral retinoids not only have a peeling effect but also decrease the production of oil.\n\n                + They can also be associated with a number of serious side effects including birth defects in babies of wome", "doctor_answer": "GET PROACTIVE--IT DOES WORK"}

This is especially so if the stone is stuck, causing obstruction and infection of the urinary tract. Laser, ultrasonic, and mechanical (pneumatic, shock-wave) are forms of energy employed to fragment stones.", "doctor_answer": "Some people get kidney stones.  If they take food with more of calcium oxalate crystals,like tomato,milk, plums etc, they develop stones. Some devlop if the take more of uric acid as in non vegetarian diet and proteins.

If big by lithotropsy (by breaking it with sound waves) .If still bigger by  surgery."}
{"question": "why do your fingers get wrinkled when you get out of the water?", "patient_answer": "The skin of your fingers absorb water/ fluid and swell also.", "doctor_answer": "The skin of your finger consists of tiny little skin cells, 100's and 100's of millions of them.  Each cell is so small you would need a powerful microscope for looking at 100 of them.\n\nAll cells are surrounded by a membrane.  Somewhat like a very, very tiny balloon filled with salty jello.  The insides of the outermost cells are salty and dehydrated because your skin grows from underneath, the dermis, close to the capillaries (blood supply).\n\nThe outer skin, called the epidermis, consists of cells which are wearing out and drying up, although they are mostly not quite dead yet.  The very oldest ones that are dead come off when you scrub or shower. Some are falling off all the time, but they are so small you do not see them.\n\nSince the epidermis consists of rather dry cells, it is able to absorb water.  The cell walls allow the water in your tub, shower, or pool to penetrate into each cell.  The insides, being salty, are have a strong affinity for water.  \n\nIf you spend a long time in the water, the epidermal cells swell up, increasing in size, somewhat like the the balloons mentioned earlier being filled with more water.\n\nWhen the skin on the outside of your hands or toes swells it has more surface area than previously.  Instead of being like a tight fitting glove, it becomes more like a glove that is too big.\n\nIf you put on a glove that is too big, it will have wrinkles instead of being stretched smoothly.\n\nThe entry of water into a cell is called osmosis.  If you stay in fresh water for an extremely long time, many cells will absorb so much water they will burst.  That is called lysis.\n\nRed blood cells are much more fragile than skin cells.  When combined with fresh water they rapidly absorb so much water that they all appear to dissolve.  Each one of the millions and millions of red blood cells has burst.  That is called hemolysis.\n\nRopes made from plant fibers are also composed of cells.  Test a rope:  See if it shrinks in length when absorbing water or drying out.\n\nWhen the skin on your fingers and toes dries out, the cells shrink in size, and the skin becomes more smooth and taut, like a tight, well fitted glove.\n\nYour skin is very important.  Without it you would be just like a raw piece of meat, ready for the flies and germs to eat.\n\nTake good care of your skin.  Do not get sunburned.  When you have a bad cut that is healing, you should try to keep your hands out of dirty water or ponds.\nThese contain potentially dangerous bacteria that could infect your open or healing wound.\n\nTaking a shower or washing your hands in clean water is okay.  Just be sure to put antibiotic ointment and a fresh bandage over the cut when you are done.\n\nYour teacher might be able to show you some pictures of bacteria (germs) or let you look at live ones through a microscope.  \n\nOnly one person is allowed to look through at a time.  Everyone else must stand back and not push the observer or touch their head.  Otherwise you could injure one of their eyes or both by knocking them into the eyepiece or binoculars of the microscope.\n\nSome people have gone blind that way.  No horsing around !!  Strictly enforced.\n\nDuring winter, good skin care means putting lotion on your hands and wearing gloves while outside in the cold winter air.\n\nPeople who drink a carrot milkshake daily, made in a blender, have very beautiful skin once they have done this for six months.\n\nHealthy skin makes both boys and girls look better."}

{"question": "Why do women who spend a lot of time together have their periods at the same time?", "patient_answer": "A: Women (and men) secrete odorless molecules, called pheromones, in a manner as common as sweating. In fact, the sweat of many mammals contains pheromone chemicals. The molecules from one woman bounce and jiggle their way airborne and waft to another. Receptors in the nose detect the pheromones and the second woman responds by shortening or lengthening her menstrual period. Gradually, over the course of a few months, the periods of all the women living together synchronize in this way.", "doctor_answer": "It's called synchronious menstruation.  It's happened to me on two occasions.  Once at a camp where there were about 30 girls in a cabin, and I swear to you, every single one of us got our periods over a period of 10 days.

{"question": "I need to know about cnv in new borns.What is it? What caused it?", "patient_answer": "Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is normally associated with macular degeneration. Most of the time, this occurs when new blood vessels grow through cracks in tissue layers beneath the retina called Bruch's membrane. As CNV progresses, the abnormal vessels may leak fluid and bleed.  Eventually this process causes damage to the overlying retina. Decreased and/or distorted vision will often occur. As for the cause in a newborn, I would guess that it would be an inherited eye disease.", "doctor_answer": "I think that you mean CMV, cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus related to the herpes virus group of infections. Like herpes, it is inactive at times, but it is incurable and is a life-time infection. CMV may be passed from a mother to her baby during pregnancy and is the most common congenital viral infection. It is also called congenital cytomegalovirus or cytomegalovirus inclusion disease. CMV without symptoms is common in babies and young children. It is found in saliva, urine, semen, and other body fluids. The virus is easily spread in households and in daycare centers. It can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy and to the baby during delivery or in breast milk.\n\nOver half of women of childbearing age become infected with CMV at least six months before becoming pregnant. There appear to be few risks for complications of CMV for this group and only a few babies have the infection at birth. These babies appear to have no significant illness or abnormalities.\n\nAbout 90 percent of babies who are infected with CMV have no symptoms at birth. But as many as 15 percent of these babies develop one or more neurological abnormalities — such as mental retardation, learning disabilities, hearing or vision loss — usually in the first year or two of life. Congenital CMV infection is a leading cause of hearing loss in children.\n\nAbout one in 1,000 babies (about 4,000 babies each year) shows symptoms of CMV at birth. These symptoms may include an enlarged spleen or liver, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and a distinctive rash. Up to 20 percent of these babies die, and about 90 percent of the survivors suffer from serious neurological defects, such as mental retardation.\n\nAt present there is no treatment that can halt or reverse the effects of congenital CMV. However, doctors are investigating whether a new antiviral drug called ganciclovir — which is used to treat adults with AIDS who have CMV-related eye infections — also may help babies with congenital CMV."}

{"question": "My 6-year-old daughter had an ear infection and after Amoxicillin is having hearing trouble?", "patient_answer": "Give it time. With an ear infection you usually have some fluid build up behind the eardrum. Even if the fever is gone, the fluid (and the bacteria in it)can still be there.

{"question": "why are cigarretes legal knowing they can cause cancer?", "patient_answer": "There are many things that are legal even though we think they may cause cancer. Like french fries. The law however does mandate, that there is a warning on cigarettes about their health risk. (Sort of the same thing as those warning on garages in California (\"this building contains chemicas known to the state of california to cause cancer or birth defects.\")). Anyways, the government can't make everything that is unhealthy illegal, nor can they coerce you into a healthy lifestyle. That would be against your civil rights. However, what they can do is tax these unhealthy things (like high taxes on tobacco and alcohol in most countries, high taxes on gas in Europe, etc.).", "doctor_answer": "lots of things are legal, even though they are harmful ,alchohol,cigarrets,even watching television. its not up to the government to decide what’s healthy for an each person. though they make life tough by taxes and laws(most Muslim countries ban alcohol as its against their religion, Singapore has high taxes on cigarretes)its up to you to decide .

{"question": "What's the best way to get rid of acne?", "patient_answer": "I would contact a dermatologist for the 'best' way.\n\nOther steps\n\n1. Wash your face at least twice a day with a mild cleanser. Use a pH-balanced cleanser without perfumes or too many chemical additives.\n \n2. Touch your face as little as possible, and only when your hands are clean.\n \n3. Avoid squeezing pimples. Bacteria on your hands or on unsterile equipment can lead to more blemishes and possible scarring.\n \n4. Steam your face once or twice a week to help open the pores. Boil water, remove the pot from the stove, drape a towel over your head and hold your face over the pot. Then rinse your face with cold water. \n \n5. Use essential oils such as calendula, chamomile, juniper, lavendar and mint directly on your skin. Mix 10 drops of any of the oils with 2 tbsp. soy or almond oil, and smooth a few drops on dampened skin.\n \n6. Try using herbs. Saw palmetto can help balance boys' hormones, while chaste tree berry can do the same for girls. Echinacea, alfalfa, burdock root, cayenne, chaparral and yellow dock root are also helpful.\n \n7. Consider other topical mixtures. Beat an egg yolk, apply it with a cotton ball and leave it on for 15 minutes. Alternatively, mix oatmeal and honey together to form a paste and apply it to your face. Oatmeal soaks up excess oil and honey soothes the skin.\n \n8. Take acidophilus to fight bacteria.\n \n9. Eat a diet high in fiber, including whole grains and fresh vegetables and fruits, to keep your body healthy overall and provide nutrients to your skin. Stay away from junk food, caffeine and salty foods.\n \n10. Determine whether specific foods aggravate your skin and eliminate them from your diet.\n \n11.

Hypnosis is not a magic wand.  Sexual dysfunction is an interesting one because many times the cause is something physical. I have told people to see their doctor first and it turns out that they are diabetic or some other health related issue.  Dysfunction is one of the leading indicators that there are other things going on that need to be checked out.  If every thing is ok and you want a little boost, hypnosis can be great.  Doing it with your partner can be wonderful. Much of hypnosis is about belief and trust.  Making the avenues of communication and trust stronger between partners will always help. \n\nIn the case of inhibition, hypnosis is not mind control.  It can't be use to make you do something that you don't want to do.  It can be used to make you more comfortable with an idea that you chose to explore.  It can be use to help you explore why you are uncomfortable with a subject and if these inhibitions are something you want to modify.

An inguinal hernia occurs in the groin (the area between the abdomen and thigh). It is called \"inguinal\" because the intestines push through a weak spot in the inguinal canal, which is a triangle-shaped opening between layers of abdominal muscle near the groin. Obesity, pregnancy, heavy lifting, and straining to pass stool can cause the intestine to push against the inguinal canal.\n\nSymptoms of inguinal hernia may include a lump in the groin near the thigh; pain in the groin; and, in severe cases, partial or complete blockage of the intestine. The doctor diagnoses hernia by doing a physical exam and by taking x rays and blood tests to check for blockage in the intestine.\n\nThe main treatment for inguinal hernia is surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. This surgery is called herniorrhaphy. Sometimes the weak area is reinforced with steel mesh or wire. This operation is called hernioplasty. If the protruding intestine becomes twisted or traps stool, part of the intestine might need to be removed. This surgery is called bowel resection. (Bowel is another word for intestine.)"}

{"question": "have you heard of schlerdoma? (spell check)?", "patient_answer": "From emedicine:  Scleroderma is a systemic disease that affects many organ systems. It is most obvious in the skin; however, the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory, renal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems, as well as numerous vascular structures, are involved frequently. The symptoms result from progressive tissue fibrosis and occlusion of the microvasculature by excessive production and deposition of types I and III collagens. Other macromolecules found in the connective tissue (eg, glycosaminoglycans, tenascin, fibronectin) also are increased. The vascular alterations show a predilection for affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. The small vessel cytoskeleton is affected by structural defects that lead to collapse. Next, the tight junctions become altered and are no longer functional, allowing the endothelium to slip into the vessel lumen.\n\nFrom webmd:  Scleroderma (pronounced SKLEER-oh-der-ma) is Greek for hard skin. It's classified as both a connective-tissue disorder and a rheumatic condition. In scleroderma, the skin gradually tightens and thickens or hardens. It loses its ability to stretch. Tiny blood vessels throughout the body also may be affected, causing widespread damage to the internal organs.", "doctor_answer": "yes.\nscleroderma.\nwhy?"}

{"question": "Any help for aging thin cancerous skin that's sensitive to almost everything?", "patient_answer": "Please listen to me as I am only here to help. You have to do exactly as I say. Go to the website and look up CESIUM CHLORIDE AND OXYGEN DROPS. The other ones could be green algae and paw paw, etc etc. These medicines are known in the medical field, but they dont talk about it. Because these are natural remedies with no toxic chemicals in it. So, thats why they cant profit from it. If they cant profit, they dont sell. I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies. They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing. What do you have to live with after chemo? Your body is not sunburned, its practically microwaved. CESIUM CHLORIDE can be taken with OXYGEN DROPS. Go to the websites. You can go to these websites and they will give a whole package for you to buy. You can take these medicines over the course of 3 months, a year, or whatever they prescribe. After your mom is feeling well, taking it for about 2 months or more, you can almost garauntee that you are cured. But, you have to listen to them and take it till they tell you to stop. They even cure certain 3rd stage cancers with a 90% success rate. But, time is of the essence so I urge you to buy it as soon as possible and take next day delivery or something. I wish you the best of luck in the future. But, heed my warning, do not go into chemo. They always tell you something fuzzy like, oh..you might live another 2 years, or you might die right away..etc etc....Then how do you decide? But, they always say that people who have been on chemo will only live a maximum of X years after that.

{"question": "how fast can i see results from doing sit ups?", "patient_answer": "First, you should stick with crunches..they are less stressful on your back and focus more on the correct muscles. Then, if you cut out all fat from your diet and limit your caloric intake, you will see results in 3 - 4 weeks. That is, if you are doing a serious ab routinue of at least 25 minutes/day (with 1 day off a week).\nIf you have a not-so-healthy eating lifestyle, doing sit ups will not help and you will most likely not see any results unless you are doing a complete ab workout (obliques, crunches, roman chair, scissors, leg lifts, etc.) for at least 2 hours/day. \nThe best way is to cut fat (soda, junk food are the easiest) and gradually build into a harder and harder workout where you start at 3 sets of 30 sit ups for a week and add one set and 10 reps per set every week. In ten weeks, you will have a solid workout that will produce very good results. With every workout routine, you should be doing a cardio-vascular exercise (running, biking, brisk walking) to burn calories. And always consult a doctor for the proper workout schedule for your age and body type.", "doctor_answer": "It really depends on your diet.  If you are burning more calories during the day than you consume, you will lose weight (to a point), and eventually see abdominal definition.  Genetics also play a significant role on how hard you will have to work (look at family members).  It also depends on how good a shape you're already in, and what other exercises you're doing.  For example, if you have a huge chest, the sheer circumference difference will make your waist look smaller."}

For immediate relief, use Maalox.  Avoid Pepto Bismol, as it has something that irritates the stomach long term (my gastroenterologist told me that!).  For longer term use, use Priolosec.\n\n2.  Stop eating at least 3 hours before you get in bed.  A reclining position with food in your stomach irritates the esophogus.  You would be AMAZED at how much this helps.

{"question": "What  are the symptoms Fetal Alcohol Syndrome?", "patient_answer": "Mental retardation is the most common and serious birth defect associated with FAS.  Perhaps the most notable defects in FAS involve the face and eyes. In general, these defects are obvious and include facial bone hypoplasia (under-development), a long, underdeveloped philtrum (the groove in the middle of the upper lip), a thin upper lip, a short nose, and ptosis (drooping of the eyelids). Although the typical facial features may not be as apparent during the newborn period, they become more prominent as the infant develops. As these children grow into young adulthood, however, the facial abnormalities become more subtle and thereby contribute to the difficulty of recognizing FAS in older persons. With these physical abnormalities come sensory deficits that frequently involve vision, hearing and speech. Hyperacusis (abnormal acuteness of hearing) is common in infants, and approximately one third of these infants have a conductive hearing loss and another one-third have a sensorineural hearing loss. More than 90 percent of infants with FAS have delays in receptive and expressive language development.", "doctor_answer": "Please see the links listed below.

{"question": "what is aortic valve replacement?", "patient_answer": "it replaces one of the valves in your heart (which function to move the blood to the rest of the body from the heart) to improve blood flow.", "doctor_answer": "The aortic valve is the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta.  This is where fresh oxygenated blood is pumped out to the entire body.  There are a variety of diseases that can require replacement of this valve, including aortic stenosis where the valve does not properly open and close, or an aortic insufficiency where the valve allows backflow of blood from the aorta back into the left ventricle of the heart.\n\nThere are two major types of aortic valve replacements - mechanical valves and biologic/tissue valves.  Mechanical valves have been around longer and subsequently have a very refined safety and efficacy profile.  The downside is that after the procedure, the patient must be put on blood thinners for the rest of their life.  Biologic/tissue valves do not need subsequent blood thinner treatment and therefore may benefit younger, generally healthy patients.  However, it has been shown that the durability of tissue valves may be lower than mechanical valves, which may require a repeat operation later in life.\n\nThere is a variation to the above procedures called the Ross procedure.  This procedure replaces the faulty aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve.  The pulmonary valve is then replaced with a tissue valve.  The rationale for doing this is that more strain is put on the aortic valve and therefore having the person's own anatomy in that place is preferable to having a weaker mechanical or tissue valve.  The pulmonary valve, which only pumps to the lungs (and therefore doesn't have to pump as hard) can withstand having a tissue valve, which isn't as durable.  In addition, this approach does not require blood thinners after the operation.\n\nCurrent cardiac surgery research is trying to investigate if valve replacement can be done in a minimally invasive way using catheter devices."}

{"question": "Can you make an ice bag (for an injury) with a mixture of alcohol and water?", "patient_answer": "The ratio is 1 part rubbing alcohol to 2 parts water.I usually use 1 cup and 2 cups. Put the mixer in a gallon size zip lock then, place the zip lock into another zip lock to prevent any leakage. You can reuse this ice pack over and over. OR - you can make several smaller ice packs if you don't want a gallon size one.", "doctor_answer": "get a sponge like the one you might have in your kitchen,pour mixture, problably 75% water 25% alcohol on it then place in freezer bag in the freezer. i do this for my kids, this works great."}
{"question": "Why does some times when you sleep it feels like u r falling???", "patient_answer": "because you have a system in you brain (the vestibular system) that controls balance.  it basically (i think) works by the position of the fluid.  when you're lying down this is off and mindset of dreaming can contribute to you off-balancness to create the feeling of falling.", "doctor_answer": "That happens when your mind is making the transition from concious to subconcious (deep sleep mode)."}
{"question": "can years of hypertension cause diabetes?", "patient_answer": "The short answer is no. Hypertension & diabetes often are found in the same patients, but one doesn't cause the other.\n\nThere are many causes of hypertension, including an adrenalin secreting tumor, narrowing of the renal (kidney) arteries, etc. Most commonly, there is no clear cause.\n\nType 2 (adult onset) diabetes develops when your body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin or when your pancreas produces some, but not enough, insulin to maintain a normal glucose level.", "doctor_answer": "No.Definitely not.  But if both are present Hypertension will be increasing due to diabetes complications."}
{"question": "can a baby be born not trusting her mom(paranoid)?", "patient_answer": "At such a young age it is not the norm to isolate from all people, including family. It could be a form of attachment disorder, and it could be the blossoming of other disorders. A child that exibits such behaviors needs to be assessed for many things. A good child psychiatrist and therapist can test for autism spectrum disorders, but if the child has good verbal skills, that is unlikely. They can also be assessed for attachement disorders, and other types of disorders. Find a good children's center or hospital in your area.", "doctor_answer": "There is a more likely chance that your baby does trust you but may have been born with a chemical imbalance. Have you taken her to an ALL natural health practicioner?"}

It makes you just want to keep on flipping the chanels and not really watch anything, but it does eat the fat right off your body."}
{"question": "any advise to help boost sperm count?", "patient_answer": "Caffeine, smoking, and drugs are things that can very much effect sperm count.  Also wearing tight clothing.  \nDelaying ejaculation may increase the total concentration of sperm and perhaps the volume of semen. However, the percentage of normal sperm and the percentage of motile sperm decreases with infrequent ejaculation. A new study found a combination of folic acid and zinc supplements increased sperm count by 74% in men with fertility problems. Researchers found that the men with fertility problems who took 5 mg of folic acid a day and 66 mg of zinc sulfate a day for 26 weeks had a 74% increase in total normal sperm count and a minor (4%) increase in abnormal sperm count.", "doctor_answer": "Tell him to quit masturbating. He should also wear boxers and stop smoking."}
{"question": "Running a fever - 102.0, to be exact.?", "patient_answer": "Watch for early signs of dehydration and drink extra fluids, especially water. Adults should drink at least 10 glasses of liquid a day to replenish lost fluids. Children between the ages of 4 and 10 should drink at least 6 to 10 glasses. You may feel better if you eat light, easily digested foods, such as soup. Many people find that taking a lukewarm [80° (26.7°) to 90° (32.2°)] shower or bath makes them feel better when they have a fever. Do not try to take a shower if you are dizzy or unsteady on your feet. Increase the water temperature if you start to shiver. Shivering is a sign that your body is trying to raise its temperature. Do not use rubbing alcohol, ice, or cold water to cool your body. Dress lightly when you have a fever. This will help your body cool down. Wear light pajamas or a light undershirt. Do not wear very warm clothing or use heavy bed covers. Keep room temperature at 70° (21.1°) or lower. Take a nonprescription medication to help relieve your fever- Acetaminophen, such as Tylenol or Panadol, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Ibuprofen, such as Advil or Motrin \nNaproxen, such as Aleve or Naprosyn,Ketoprofen, such as Actron or Orudis,Aspirin (also a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) Be sure to check your temperature every 2 to 4 hours to make sure home treatment is working. If fever does not subside or your temp increases, see a doctor.", "doctor_answer": "Just don't get too hot or cold, cuz I know when you have a fever you feel really hot and then really cold, so don't overheat yourself"}
{"question": "Are you aware of the strange smells?", "patient_answer": "I didn't have any particular title that described me until just now.  Thank you.  I'm a crevice sniffer.\n\nBut I can't reach my belly button.  How do I do that? what if it has a bad smell, like something was left in there too long.  Do I ask another crevice sniffer to check for me?  Is that proper?  and how do you know someone is a crevice sniffer without flat out asking them?", "doctor_answer": "No. And try as I might, I probably won't be able to. Because of this abnormalty called \"anosmia\" I have no sense of smell. I can taste, but I can't smell. Oddly enough, it kept me from joining the NAVY. But I don't let that one sense keep me from learning as though I had it. True, it is a lot slower learning if you cannot smell, but I might as well learn what I can and react accordingly. BTW, I learned something today. Thanks, girl."}

{"question": "would i contract aids i had o r a l sex with a h i v positive female?", "patient_answer": "Yes .  Positively.", "doctor_answer": "As stated, higher than abstinence.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control specifies several ways that a recipient of oral_ sex may contract HIV: the lining of the urethra (the opening at the tip of the penis_), the lining of the vagina_ or cervix, the lining of the anus_, or directly into the body through small cuts or open sores. The chances increase if the person performing sex has cuts or sores in her mouth.\n\nThe chances exist, though the precise odds are uncertain, though non-negligible."}
{"question": "why do men have nipples?", "patient_answer": "Every egg starts developing in the womb as a female. The male genes kick in only later during the gestation. Consequently, an egg developing into a foetus develops nipples. After a certain stage, when the male genes kick in, the development of the breast is stopped. Thus men have nipple but don't have breast.", "doctor_answer": "Because of evolution. Nearly all male mammals have nipples as its common to the body plan."}

The disease takes its less-scientific name from Lou Gehrig, a baseball player with the New York Yankees in the late 1920s and 1930s, who was forced to retire in 1939 as a result of the loss of motor control caused by the disease. \n\nIn 1991, a team of researchers linked familial ALS to chromosome 21. Two years later, the SOD1 gene was identified as being associated with many cases of familial ALS. The enzyme coded for by SOD1 carries out a very important function in cells: it removes dangerous superoxide radicals by converting them into non-harmful substances. Defects in the action of this enzyme mean that the superoxide radicals attack cells from the inside, causing their death. Several different mutations in this enzyme all result in ALS, making the exact molecular cause of the disease difficult to ascertain.\n\nRecent research has suggested that treatment with drugs called antioxidants may benefit ALS patients. However, since the molecular genetics of the disease are still unclear, a significant amount of research is still required to design other promising treatments for ALS"}

{"question": "how does one catch a cold?", "patient_answer": "If you touch something that has a virus or bacteria that causes a cold, and you touch something that you are eating, or if you rub your eyes or your mouth, that bacteria will be introduced to your systems. Since there are over 200 types of colds, it is unlikely that you will be immune to even half of them.", "doctor_answer": "Cold virus is in the air...so whatever you place you go and the virus is there, you will catch it, specially if another person gots it."}
{"question": "I've had my first period when I was 15 and have never had it since then. Is there an alternative to the pill?", "patient_answer": "I used to get the Depo Provera shot, which is almost the same as the pill. I started getting it when I was 15, was on it for 2 years and then stopped. It took almost a year for me to get my period. I recently started again a few years ago and have been off of it for a little over a year and my period still isn't regular. My OB/GYN said that it can take up to 2 years for your body to rid itself of the birth control (whether it be the pill or the shot) and go back to normal. Just be patient. It'll balance out eventually.", "doctor_answer": "Early menopause is often an over looked cause. Birth control pills, also causes frequent missed periods.\n\nNevertheless, you should contact a Physician/Gynecologist in your area in regards to this issue so that he/she can rule out the possibility of a tumor. Amenorrhea (Absence of Menstruation) is actually only a symptom resulting from a glandular malfunction, a chronic disease, a metabolic disorder such as diabetes, obesity, malnutrition, and tumors, or more importantly, a neurosis precipitated by emotional distress (unhappy love affair, divorce, and the like). However, hormonal treatment is most frequently employed when the possibility of tumor has been ruled out; while neurotic disorders may require psychiatric help, but even in this case, hormonal theraphy can be very helpful.\n\nAgain, much depends on the underlying trouble; some cases can be completly cured, for others medical help is limited. I recommend visiting eMedicine's Patient Education Center for a list of other Self-Care at Home options as well http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/53430-6.asp .\n\nHope this answers your question,"}
{"question": "why isn't it that there so many hiv aids victim get from blood transmissions?", "patient_answer": "I would add that while there is no vaccine and no cure, medicine has made significant strides in treating/managing HIV/AIDS.  While it is still a very serious and often fatal disease, it is not the death sentence that it was 20 years ago.  Things like protease inhibitors and strong antibiotics for some opportunistic infections have very much changed the way the disease is managed in a given patient.", "doctor_answer": "Before you can donate blood you have to be at NO risk for having the disease (as well as several other diseases such as malaria). You are tested before you can give blood to make sure you do not have any blood born diseases. \n\nAs for doctors, nurses, etc... they are at risk for getting HIV anytime they treat a patient. There is a protocol if you think you have been infected where you take certain medications within 1 hour of the event, for up to 6 months. This MAY prevent the disease.\n\nThere is no cure since most people are not aware they got AIDS until a longer period of time into the illness. The virus is very tricky because it mutates all the time, thus we are unable to design a drug that will work with any mutant form of the virus. Furthermore, the virus \"hides\" inside your own white blood cells (cells that usually are designed to kill viruses)."}
{"question": "How do you overcome panic attacks? I've struggled with them for years.?", "patient_answer": "I have not had a panic attack in four years.  Where counseling and drugs failed, information worked.  I took a college class on abnormal psychology, and that helped me objectify panic attacks as biological overreactions that had nothing to do with who was really me.  I sincerely hope this helps!", "doctor_answer": "you should get away from everything that makes you panic, or just call a doctor they could help you"}
{"question": "is it possible for someone glands to be swollen in their neck and dont know it?", "patient_answer": "my father once had thyroid cancer for almost a month before he noticed it", "doctor_answer": "Glands are usually ALWAYS a little swollen when you have a cold, are sneezing, etc... the way you find about it is when you touch right below your cheekbone and it hurts."}

{"question": "Does anyone know what Addison's disease is?", "patient_answer": "Addison's disease (also known as chronic adrenal insufficiency, or hypocortisolism) is a rare endocrine disorder, first described by British physician Thomas Addison.\n\nIt is estimated that it affects about 1 to 2 in 100,000 people.\n\nIt occurs when the adrenal glands, seated above the kidneys, fail to produce enough of the hormone cortisol and, sometimes, the hormone aldosterone.\n\nAddison's disease refers specifically to primary adrenal insufficiency, in which the adrenal glands themselves malfunction; secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland does not produce enough adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to adequately stimulate the adrenal glands.", "doctor_answer": "Addison's Disease is a disease caused by partial or total failure of adrenocortical function, which is characterized by a bronzelike pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes, anemia, weakness, and low blood pressure."}
{"question": "my son says his hands are hot all the time.

{"question": "how many times can a person go through Defibrillation?", "patient_answer": "Your focusing on the wrong end here...the body can handle as many times as it needs to, in order to get the heart pumping to keep the body alive. The heart failing is far more a concern than the defib. The defib, you can think of it like a jump start, for a low battery. \n\nBypass surgery is a major event for the body to handle, but coding in the care of professionals in the ICU is a far better situation, neurologically speaking, than coding in the field. Quick rescusitation with a code team at bedside, means your loved one will probably continue to adequately perfuse the brain with needed oxygenated blood to prevent permanent brain damage. \n\nI wish you and your family the best of luck.", "doctor_answer": "Most hospitals only shock their patients a total of 3 times at 400.  This means that if there is no responce after the 3rd shock, they probably won't shock them again.\n\nFor the home defibs, and sport defibs, that is computer controlled untill the paramedics arrive on site.  in general, however, the defib machines will shock untill they recieve some confirmation of heart activity.  If there is no activity then they will increase the amount to be shocked up to the maximum and continue to shock."}
{"question": "the safest weight training apparatus?", "patient_answer": "The safest thing is to have someone else with you as a spotter.  Machines aren't necessarily safer than free weights, because clothing can get snagged, fingers pinched in the equipment, etc.  Most of all, though, injuries come from bad form.  Having another person watch you to make sure you're not leaning funny, even on machines, can really stave off all sorts of minor aches and pains.", "doctor_answer": "Your best bet would probably be a smith machine since it is self spotting you can never really drop the weight on yourself.A leverage machine is also self spotting."}

The biggest thing to do is stop smoking and start exercising.  Maintaining a proper diet is also important.  If there is high blood pressure in your family, it is also important to make sure you visit your family physician at least once a year for a regular physical so that your doctor can monitor your blood pressure.", "doctor_answer": "All the causes are not known :\n\n1) Sometimes u just get it\n2) Too much salt\n3) you are overweight\n4) You dont exercise"}

{"question": "What is \"Inadequate Personality Disorder?\"?", "patient_answer": "Inadequate Personality Disorder is, in fact, accepted terminology.  It is also sometimes referred to as Asthenic or Dependent Personality Disorder.   \nIn this condition, the person lacks the mental energy and ability to act on his/her own initiative and therefore becomes passive, allowing others to assume responsibility for major aspects of his/her life.", "doctor_answer": "Mental health diagnoses are evolving.  At one time, inadequate personality disorder was used to describe someone who lacked the mental energy to take charge of his/her own life, allowing others to do so.  This term is no longer used, and has not been for some time.  The closest match in the current manual (DSM IV-TR) is Borderline Personality Disorder, which has less subjective diagnostic criteria."}

{"question": "How do you stop being depressed?", "patient_answer": "How long is a piece of string? Because that's what you're asking. Forget Jesus too. I mean faith has nothing to do with this. And why the heck do those trolls come here? Anyway, what it comes down to is what state your mental condition is in right now and how it impacts on your quality of life. Obviously it's not too bad at the moment because you've managed to cope with a big move, new city, and no friends around you. Doesn't sound like a person not in complete control of their life to me. Gee, can I ask what exactly you are depressed about?\n\nSo, my point is that you can only be helped if you're willing to let others help you. This of course means taking advice from someone in a professional enough position to comment on your condition (e.g. how bad it is). Sure, you may need medication or you may not. Why do you refuse to take drugs anyway? You know eventually you may not even have a choice in taking some. Have you thought about that?\n\nOverall, my opinion is that I think the first thing you need to do is forget about 5 minute solutions. Depression doesn't work like that. And if you think it does, well, perhaps you need to seek a different diagnosis. A professional one perhaps? I mean Joe Public can only help so much.", "doctor_answer": "for me iam at my happiest when i play with video games. but mainly long walks-up to 6 miles 3-4 times a day. plus i get involve with yahoo answers and feel better too."}

{"question": "when reaching climax is it normal not to release fluids, and if so is this a medical condition?", "patient_answer": "Yeah! Don't worry about it, it tends to be something found in a lot of women. If it is a problem, I would suggest investing in a lubrication (I, personally, use Astroglide), it cuts down on the painful friction. Otherwise I wouldn't worry a bit about it.\n\nYeah, even after orgasm, if you don't produce any extra fluid don't worry :P Some women produce none, a little, and some can even ejaculate like a man (I think Howard Stern actually had a woman come in and show him how she ejaculated, ew) But it's not a problem when you don't, I don't really either, and everything down there's functional. If you are that worried, get it checked out, it's better to be safe than sorry. In my studies in human sexuality, though, I have never come across a disease in which too little \"juice\" is a predictor of any problems, or pregnancy down there.", "doctor_answer": "It's absolutely normal, I second what Kristy had to say. There is no standard for a certain amount being excreted during or post-orgasm. Everybody's different! Seeing a professional might be a good idea if you notice a change in color, smell, or consistency of your own secretions as it could be indicative of an infection or STD of some kind. Regular gyno exams and being familiar with your own body are essential to staying on top of its care. But any detail provided in your question does not seem to be cause for concern at all."}

As long as the machine is providing the desired results (no snoring or apnea), then I'm pretty sure nothing else need be done.  Obviously, you need to maintain the filters--clean or replace, as the case may be.", "doctor_answer": "They onyl need to be adjusted if you are having problems.

{"question": "does chronic sinusitis cause dizziness?", "patient_answer": "Not generally, no. However if the infection should get to your ears, which wouldn't be uncommon, it can affect the vestibular system, thus making you dizzy. Generally speaking, if you are having dizziness, you should see your doctor to get some antibiotics (if not taking them already) as an inner ear infection can do bad things if left unchecked. One should also consider the possibility that something else could be causing the dizziness at the brainstem...which would be really bad! Either case, see your Dr.", "doctor_answer": "Not directly.  But the same health conditions that cause chronic sinusitis can contribute to dizziness - which is generally caused by low blood pressure.  Drinking more water helps both - it keeps the sinus fluids moving to clear and prevent sinus infections, and it keeps the blood minerals balanced to keep your blood pressure up."}

It's also good to keep active doing things that help you feel good, and are healthy like excercise or recreational activities.  Drugs and alcohol make it worse, as does sleeping all day (which is probably what you want to do).  If the depression is chemical, then anti-depressants can be helpful, but I think that should be only as a last resort when you are sure it's a chemical problem.

{"question": "What's the best remedy for arthritic hands?", "patient_answer": "Well, it's basically an inflammation.  Anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen can be an enormous help.  Unfortunately, oral administration distributes the drug to the whole body, and the place where you need it can be under-treated.  Plus, ibuprofen and aspirin can cause stomach problems if you start raising the dosage.  \n\nThere is a solution- topical administration.  Ask your doctor for a prescription for ibuprofen cream.  It is usually called something else, like ketoprofen, and can be made with a topical pain-reliever such as bupivicane (like lidocaine).  Keep in mind your doctor may not have heard of it, and that it has to be compounded.  Check your phonebook for local compounding pharmacies so that you can give your doctor their phone number. Typically the cream comes as 10-20% active, which is possible because it will never be in your stomach to cause problems.  Unfortunately, because it has to be compounded, your insurance company will probably not cover it in the same way as regular drugs.  You may be looking at paying $50 for a 4oz jar. \n\nWhen you apply- be sure to really rub and massage the cream into your hands hard for 5-10 minutes.  This will help just as much as the ibuprofen will, because the muscle work will greatly increase blood flow to the area.  Together, massage and anti-inflammatory therapy can provide great relief.\n\nResults vary with patient.

{"question": "Im keeping a food diary to control my food intake, as I have to drop about 30 pounds.  Does it really work?", "patient_answer": "Experts say writing down your eating habits will keep your diet on track -- even when you slip up and eat a few things you wish you hadn't.\n\nFood journals can help keep portions under control. For example, don't just write that you ate chicken for dinner. Write down how many ounces that piece of chicken was. And how many pieces you consumed. Information on gauging portions can be found on the Internet. If you are not seeing a dietician, you can cross-check your daily food intake with the USFDA food guide pyramid.

The iodine in the soil between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalacians was depleted with the last ice age.  In the early 1900s there were such outbreaks of goiter, that the area was nicknamed the \"goiter belt\" and iodine was added to our salt.  It was also used as a conditioner in bread and in the red food dye that was used in hot dogs.

On days when it is clear and stringy, it means you are ovulating.  You can also use software to record your basal temp and mucus findings, and it will calculate when would be the optimum fertility time, along with other information.

About 50% develop Aids within10 years of infection.  but he number long term is increrasing .Progression of Aids is aslo affected by age at HIV infection mode of transmission and by genetic factors.

Turns out I can't use Secret (which pretty much knocks out Suave too, since it's named to be Secret's imitaion).  I use Dove now and am fine.\n\nSwitch deodorants and be extra gentle to that area for the time being.  I know it will totally suck, but do not shave your armpits until the spot is healed.  Depending on the severity, you may want to see a doctor.  If it's a relatively small spot, you can probably get away with just applying an antibiotic cream (such as Neosporin) to it a few times a day.  Also, you shouldn't use deodorant on that spot either.", "doctor_answer": "Perhaps if it is \"burned\" you should let it heal naturely.  The outer layer of skin is constantly being shed.

{"question": "Why do I keep losing weight but my waist will not go down any further?", "patient_answer": "You need to target exercises on your abdominal muscles.", "doctor_answer": "In order to be succeed at thinning your waistline, you have to get a basic under standing of how the abdominal muscles function and how your body burns fat.\n\nThe first thing that you need to understand is the difference between fat and muscle tissue. Fat is created by eating excess calories and it is primarily stored in layers on top of your muscles. Muscle tissue consists of fibers that contract to produce movement.\n\nFat can't turn into muscle, and muscle can't turn into fat. But you can lose muscle mass while you gain fat. That's what happens to most people, especially as they begin to get a little older.\n\nSo if your goal is a trim waist line and a nice flat stomach, the first thing you need to do is remove the layers of fat that are sitting on top of your abs. Everyone has a flat stomach. It's just that some of them are covered with excess fat. \n\nThe most effective way to flatten your stomach is with a combination of strength training (placing an extra focus on the mid-section), cardiovascular exercises (short, intensive workouts), and a stable blood sugar level to keep you from adding even more fat (and it makes it easier for the body to use your body fat for fuel). \nYou have to do some type of progressive strength training. The ab muscle is primarily used to flex your torso forward. But there are also muscles that flex your torso to the side and other muscles that rotate it. Often you will see people on their ab roller every day doing lots of sit-ups or crunches. \n\nIf you want to effectively strengthen your stomach muscles you need to incorporate these exercises: \n  \n1-2 forward flexion exercises (sit-up, crunch, etc.) \n  \n1-2 side flexion exercises (side crunches, side bends, etc.) \n  \n1-2 rotational exercises (standing twists, trunk rotations, etc.)\n  \nYour abs are muscles, and just like any other muscles, they should be exercised at most 3 times per week. You also want to make sure you're training them progressively, which means working them harder each time. \n  \nIncrease metabolism using short, and hard, cardio workouts. Cardio workouts are very important because they can, if done properly, increase your metabolism for up to 24 hours or more!\n\nThis means that you're less likely to store any excess calories as body fat simply because they're more likely to be used up by your higher metabolism. Plus, you're more likely to burn off some excess body fat in the process! \n\nHere's a simple interval workout that you can do with just about any activity (bicycling, walking, swimming, etc).\n  \nWarm up at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes \n  \nPerform 30 seconds of hard exercise (almost as hard as possible) \n  \nperform one minute of moderate exercise (recovery time to catch your breath) \n  \nRepeat this process from 6-10 times \n  \nCool down at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes  \n  \nMaintaining a stable blood sugar level is the key. Most importantly, you have to stabilize your blood sugar level! This is by far the most important factor when it comes to shedding that excess body fat and keeping it off!\n\nTo stabilize your blood sugar level you have to feed your body frequently, about every 2-3 hours. The key is to give your body only the amount of food that it needs at that time. Your body burns calories all day long, so why would you only feed it once or twice a day?\n\nGive your body the fuel it needs: fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins (fish, lean beef, chicken, eggs, etc). \n\nMost people pay too much attention to how much fat is in food, or how healthy a meal is. Calories are calories. It doesn’t matter where they come from. If there’s extra it's going to body fat! \n\nI'm not saying that what you eat isn't important because it is. It just doesn’t have all that much of an affect when it comes to losing fat. Make healthy choices whenever possible, but don’t feel like every cheeseburger you eat is guaranteed to be st"}

There are currently 2.2 million people suffering from Schizophrenia in the US today.  Worldwide, the disease affects about 1% of the population.", "doctor_answer": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disease. Approximately 1 percent of the population develops schizophrenia during their lifetime – more than 2 million Americans suffer from the illness in a given year. Although schizophrenia affects men and women with equal frequency, the disorder often appears earlier in men, usually in the late teens or early twenties, than in women, who are generally affected in the twenties to early thirties. People with schizophrenia often suffer terrifying symptoms such as hearing internal voices not heard by others, or believing that other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts, or plotting to harm them. These symptoms may leave them fearful and withdrawn. Their speech and behavior can be so disorganized that they may be incomprehensible or frightening to others. Available treatments can relieve many symptoms, but most people with schizophrenia continue to suffer some symptoms throughout their lives; it has been estimated that no more than one in five individuals recovers completely. \n\nChildren with ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, and other emotional disturbances are often misdiagnosed as Schizophrenia."}

I've been trying to convince her that filling her life with more waste of space guys are not the way to being less lonely, especially since the guys she's attracted to have no life. I'll tell you what I told her. Finish high school. Then take some college courses. Get a job. In between times, surround yourself with a healthy circle of friends...ones that aren't after you for money, a place to sleep, or smokes. Find other young mom's who are doing the same thing. Find a MOPS group...Mother's Of Pre-schoolers. It's a mother's group, who meet regularly (weekly) and get together with their children, sharing tips, recipes, cleaning ideas, and each others problems. Once a month, they hire a babysitter and do something together, like go to a movie, bowling or a number of other fun, wholesome activities. Getting involved with a volunteer organization will get you out of the house and helping others with bigger needs than yours. If your child is old enough (as young as 3), you can enroll them in Headstart. There are lots of activities for the parent to get involved with there, along with being with other parents who are going through some of the same things. Some people will find an grandmother-type person, who is still very active, and you help each other. She can help you with your child, being a surrogate grandma, and she can teach you what she knows. You can help her with some of the chores that are maybe a little difficult for her. The thing is to do something with your life that's meaningful to you and your child.

{"question": "how does 1 get rid of chronic constipation?", "patient_answer": "Try getting a good amount of fiber everyday.  Eat it or take it at the same time.  There are cereals with the daily dose you need also otc medicines you can use everyday.  If this doesn't work ask a doctor.", "doctor_answer": "Constipation, infrequent or irregular bowel movements, is no fun for anyone. It can be painful and uncomfortable. Constipation can be attributed to at least one of several factors: poor eating habits, lack of exercise, not eating enough fiber or drinking enough fluids, and even possibly serious illness.\n\nFortunately, there are things one can do to prevent constipation.\n\nSince dehydration can lead to constipation, one should always drink at least eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day. It’s best to avoid caffeine since it causes dehydration and can act as a diuretic. Those who do enjoy caffeinated beverages on a regular basis should do so in moderation.\n\nA healthy diet is key for preventing constipation. A high fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts ensures regularity. Consuming an apple every day, with its skin intact, is another sure way to prevent constipation. Guava is another helpful fruit, but it should be eaten with its seeds to ensure the full effect. Starchy foods should be avoided when one is constipated as this will only escalate the problem.\n\nRegular exercise will also assist in one’s quest for regularity. Even if it’s a daily stroll in the park, exercise is important.\n\nIf you’re feeling a little backed up, perhaps one or some of these remedies can help.\n\nLaxatives – There are many over the counter products to choose from in price ranges and formulas to suit everyone’s personal preference. If you’re not sure which product is right for you, check with your pharmacist or physician. Either is sure to recommend the product that is right for you. \nLemon and Honey – Mix two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of honey into a glass of warm water. Drink one glass in the morning and one in the evening to bring back regularity. \nOrange Juice and Olive Oil – Drink a glass or mug filled with half each of orange juice and olive oil. It may not taste great but it will have your plumbing running smoothly in no time. \nLicorice – Licorice has laxative qualities. Eating several pieces of real licorice will help to relieve your constipation. \nGrapes – A large bunch of grapes should do the trick. \nCastor oil and honey – Honey seems to appear in many remedies for constipation. In addition to taking it with lemon and even by itself, one can also mix one teaspoon of honey with one teaspoon of castor oil. \nSomething else a person who is suffering from constipation can try is a cup of tomato juice mixed with half a cup of sauerkraut juice and a quarter cup of carrot juice. It may not have a pleasant flavor, but it works great!\nWhen it comes to constipation, the important thing is to have a proper diet, drink water often throughout the day, and exercise on a regular basis. If your constipation lasts for longer than a week, contact your physician. In the meantime, why not try one of the above remedies?"}

Hormonal or seasonal changes may make dandruff worse.\nHere are some tips.\nLearn to manage stress. Stress affects your overall health, making you susceptible to a number of conditions and diseases. It can even help trigger dandruff or exacerbate existing symptoms. \nShampoo often. If you tend to have an oily scalp, daily shampooing to remove the excess oil may help prevent dandruff. \nCut back on styling products. Hair sprays, styling gels, mousses and hair waxes can all build up on your hair and scalp, making them oilier. Some people may even develop allergies to various hair-care products. \nEat a healthy diet. For overall good health, include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and small amounts of lean protein in your diet. \nGet a little sun. Sunlight may be good for dandruff.

{"question": "please explain about types of leukemia?", "patient_answer": "There are several types of leukemia. They are grouped in two ways. One way is by how quickly the disease develops and gets worse. The other way is by the type of blood cell that is affected.\n\nLeukemia is either acute or chronic. In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are blasts that remain very immature and cannot carry out their normal functions. The number of blasts increases rapidly, and the disease becomes worse quickly. In chronic leukemia, some blast cells are present, but in general, these cells are more mature and can carry out some of their normal functions. Also, the number of blasts increases less rapidly than in acute leukemia. As a result, chronic leukemia worsens gradually.\n\nLeukemia can arise in either of the two main types of white blood cells: lymphoid cells or myeloid cells. When leukemia affects lymphoid cells, it is called lymphocytic leukemia. When myeloid cells are affected, the disease is called myeloid or myelogenous leukemia.\n\nThese are the most common types of leukemia:\n\n1.Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. This disease also affects adults, especially those age 65 and older. \n2.Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in both adults and children. This type of leukemia is sometimes called acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). \n3.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most often affects adults over the age of 55. It sometimes occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. \n4.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurs mainly in adults. A very small number of children also develop this disease. \n5.Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon type of chronic leukemia. This and other uncommon types of leukemia are not discussed here.

Other foods high in fructose sugars can also sweeten it, but they might interact with other things in the diet and not be as effective.

{"question": "should a 2 year old get 12 mg of methadone by iv.?", "patient_answer": "Assuming that this child weighs around 25-30 pounds (11-14 kilograms), a typical STARTING DOSE of IV methadone would be 1.1-1.4mg given 2 to 6 times per day.\n\nIf the child has been treated with increasingly high doses of methadone (or other drugs like morphine, fentanyl, or Dilaudid) for a long period of time, it is possible that the methadone dosing could progress to very high doses, such as the 12mg you mention.  Examples where this might happen would include treatment of cancer or sickle cell disease.\n\nHowever, 12mg of IV methadone in a 2-year-old who does not regularly take very high doses of narcotic pain relievers would be totally inappropriate.  This would put the child at great risk of serious side effects (i.e. he/she may stop breathing or suffer serious cardiovascular problems).", "doctor_answer": "Why would a 2 year old get 12 mg of methadone by iv at all?

{"question": "what are the symtoms of testicular cancer?", "patient_answer": "Testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers in young men between the ages of 15 and 35, but the disease also occurs in other age groups, so all men should be aware of its symptoms. While testicular cancer is common among young men, young men typically do not develop any kind of cancer, so overall, testicular cancer is a relatively rare disease. This form of cancer is almost always curable if it is found early. Most testicular cancers are found by men themselves, either as a painless lump, a hardening or change in size of the testicle, or pain in the testicle. Children born with an undescended testicle have an increased risk of getting testicular cancer, regardless of whether surgery is done to correct the problem. However, the surgery should still be done to preserve fertility. The theory is that the increased risk of testicular cancer is due to whatever caused the undescended testicle, not just by the fact that the testicle was undescended.", "doctor_answer": "Common symptoms include a swelling and/or lump in one or both of the testes, a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, and a dull feeling of pain in the region of the lower abdominal area, groin, or lower back.

This results in an increase in the total tissue volume and thus an enlargement of the penis. \n\nUse the Andro Penis device 4-9 hours per day for 3-6 months. You will have time-linear flaccid and erect gains in length, and less pronounced gains in girth. The flaccid gains appear first.\n\nI've gained permanently 1.75\" length and 1\" girth since June 2005 through the use of an Andro Penis medical traction device and PowerJelq for exercises.

{"question": "What is dyslexia?", "patient_answer": "Dyslexia is a neurological disorder with biochemical and genetic markers. In its most common and apparent form, it is a disability in which a person's reading and/or writing ability is significantly lower than that which would be predicted by his or her general level of intelligence. However, as has been discovered only in the last decade, individuals may read and write perfectly and still have dyslexia (see \"characteristics\" below).\n\nThe term was coined in 1887. People are diagnosed as dyslexic when their reading problems cannot be explained by a lack of intellectual ability, inadequate instruction, or sensory problems such as poor eyesight. Because reading is a complex mental process, dyslexia has many potential causes. From a neurophysiological perspective, dyslexia can be diagnosed by close inspection of the morphology of the brain, usually upon autopsy. Dyslexia is also associated with phonological difficulties, such as enunciation.", "doctor_answer": "A learning disorder marked by impairment of the ability to recognize and comprehend written words.\n\nDyslexia is a neurological disorder with biochemical and genetic markers.

{"question": "what is Fifth Disease?", "patient_answer": "It is a infectious disease-mostly kids get--with a rash on feet, hands and mouth--it goes away in about 14 days--no big deal", "doctor_answer": "What is \"fifth disease?\"\n\nFifth disease is a mild rash illness that occurs most commonly in children. The ill child typically has a \"slapped-cheek\" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a \"cold\" a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days.\n\nWhat causes fifth disease?\n\nFifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Pet dogs or cats may be immunized against \"parvovirus,\" but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. Therefore, a child cannot \"catch\" parvovirus from a pet dog or cat, and a pet cat or dog cannot catch human parvovirus B19 from an ill child.\n\nCan adults get fifth disease?\n\nYes, they can. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease.\n\nIs fifth disease contagious?\n\nYes. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash.\n\nHow does someone get infected with parvovirus B19?\n\nParvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to \"just have a cold.\" The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. In a household, as many as 50% of susceptible persons exposed to a family member who has fifth disease may become infected. During school outbreaks, 10% to 60% of students may get fifth disease.\n\nHow soon after infection with parvovirus B19 does a person become ill?\n\nA susceptible person usually becomes ill 4 to 14 days after being infected with the virus, but may become ill for as long as 20 days after infection.\n\nDoes everyone who is infected with parvovirus B19 become ill?\n\nNo. During outbreaks of fifth disease, about 20% of adults and children who are infected with parvovirus B19 do not develop any symptoms. Furthermore, other persons infected with the virus will have a non-specific illness that is not characteristic of fifth disease. Persons infected with the virus, however, do develop lasting immunity that protects them against infection in the future.\n\nHow is fifth disease diagnosed?\n\nA physician can often diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical examination. In cases in which it is important to confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to parvovirus B19 and other germs. If immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to parvovirus B19 is detected, the test result suggests that the person has had a recent infection.\n\nIs fifth disease serious?\n\nFifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy. Joint pain and swelling in adults usually resolve without long-term disability.\n\nParvovirus B19 infection may cause a serious"}
{"question": "What does the medical term \"code black\" mean?", "patient_answer": "It means \"bomb threat\".  Owch!", "doctor_answer": "I have worked as a nurse in hospitals since June of 2001.

{"question": "what can U do to stop a headache?", "patient_answer": "alcohol.", "doctor_answer": "For me, when a headache starts, laying down in a cool, quiet, dark room with an ice pack helps.

Both of these can cause rebound headaches.\nAnother thing I find helpful is a headache balm.   They can be found at natural food stores or online at many natural soap or handmade beauty stores.  You can also purchase ingredients to make your own. Effective essential oils for headaches include peppermint, lavender, eucalyptus, rosemary, and melissa. Below is a link to a balm that Origins makes."}
{"question": "What is Rieke?", "patient_answer": "It is spelled Reiki and pertains to the use of energy to heal the body.\n\n\"Reiki is a form of Japanese spiritual healing.  This complementary medicine has its foundation in ancient Tibetan Buddhism, apparently forgotten until its rediscovery in the late 19th century.  The aim of reiki is to promote health, maintain well-being, and help people attain a higher consciousness.  Practitioners draw on \"reiki energy\" channeling it to areas of need in themselves and their patients.  They borrow terminology from physics, claiming that reiki acts at an atomic level, causing the body's molecules to vibrate with higher intensity and thus dissolving energy blockages that lead to disharmony and disease.  \n\nA treatment session lasts about an hour; the practitioner directs reike energy through his hands to the patient.  The patient lies clothed on a treatment table and the practitioner holds his hands on or over the body in 12 basic positions for about five minutes each.  This is said to balance the body's energy centers or \"chakras.\"  Some patients may feel relaxed after treatment; others feel invigorated.\"\n\nTo get in touch with your own energy body as a beginner, I recommend T'ai Chi. You can find classes at the YMCA or, sometimes, through the  adult education programs in American cities.", "doctor_answer": "i'm guessing you mean reiki?  healing by gentle touch and lots of love."}

For example, in the US in the early 20th century there were very large differences in life expectancy between people of different races, which have since lessened. There remain significant differences in life expectancy between men and women in the US and other developed countries, with women outliving men. These differences by sex have been reducing in recent years, with men's life expectancy improving at a faster rate than women's. Poverty and inequality has a very substantial effect on life expectancy. In the United Kingdom life expectancy in the wealthiest areas is ten years longer than the poorest areas and the gap appears to be increasing as life expectancy for the prosperous continues to increase while in more deprived communities there is little increase. (Department of Health -[Tackling health inequalities]: Status report on the Programme for Action\n\nAir pollution may also reduce life expectancy, especially for those living near busy roads, due to the exhaust fumes from cars. Occupation may also have a major effect on life expectancy. Well-educated professionals working in offices have a high life expectancy, while asbestos and coal miners do not.

{"question": "Is there a life insurance for people with cancer.?", "patient_answer": "Depends on the type of cancer and how far along the treatments are.  The best bet is to contact a local life agent and give them all the information. Don't try to hide anything because it could result in a denial of payout down the road.  A local agent can talk with their underwriter to determine if they can write the policy and at what health class.", "doctor_answer": "Buy term life insurance.  Its relatively cheap, like 25 buxx a month depending on age.  Go and get about 4 or 5 different policies if you think this person is going to die.  Because they pay really low.  Like 20 grand if the person dies.  But, if they die in less then 2 years,  I think its only like 2000 plus how much you paid per month for every month that you paid.  So, if you paid 25 a month for 6 months, and the person dies, they give you only 2000 plus 150.  But if you can buy 4 or 5 of these, you can find 10 grand to bury this person.  These are the only insurance companies that will sell to you because they dont have to pay back anything to you.  If you cancel with no death, they owe you nothing."}

There's some discussion over whether it's learned or a physiological problem, but it does exist.\n\nYour family is probably mocking you because to admit that your depression is valid they would have to admit that they have problems and they would have to face them.  And they might have to admit that they have contributed to your depression.  \n\nStart with a book called \"Feeling Good : The New Mood Therapy\" by David D. Burns.  This is the best book available for depression.\n\nTry to get therapy if you can.  If you can't afford it, there may be resources available to help you.

{"question": "WHat kind of sit-up is the best and most effective?", "patient_answer": "Well, situps are a waste of time.  Some people do like as much sit ups as they can to achieve that 6 pack.  And to be honest, some never get it.  Its cuz the muscles arent big enough to show a 6 pack.  There was never enough resistance to get it.  I dont recommend any type of sit ups.  I do a kung fu style push up that gives you the best results.  Imagine, everybody can do like 10 or 20, maybe 100 sit ups, but with this, some cannot even do one.  But, just because you cant do one doesnt mean you havent done any work.  Eventually, after trying every day, you will be able to do one.  And then 2, 3, and slowly you work your way to like 25.  You only need to do about 15 to 20 per day to keep that 6 pack after its there.  You lay flat on the floor on your stomach.  Then you prop your feet up in push up position.  Now you put your hands out there on the floor.  Now put them together so that they are just touching.  Now, try to do a push up.  Keep your back as straight as possible.  When you first do this, your back will have a tendency to bend because you are trying to do at least one.  Hehe.  Um, I used to be able to do 50 of these easy.  After I get it, it was a cinch.  It will take you like 1 to 2 minutes a day trying to do like 20.  Thats all it takes to keep your 6 pack.  I used to do crunches.  Elbows to knees.  They arent bad, but this is far better.  Because doing crunches, you might not be able to sit on the floor with your legs out, and lift your body with your two hands without touching the floor.  With these push ups, after you get the hang of it, you can lift yourself off the ground, with your legs parallel to the ground.  This is when you know that you are on your way.  Its the fastest, the best, and the only one that pin points right at your stomach.  Good luck.  Once there, you will need to work a difference excercise for that 8 pack.  People dont say 8 because they dont believe it exists.  It does, and I have it.  I will assist further when you are ready.  Just make sure you rate me hehee...", "doctor_answer": "crunches!!!

It hurts so good!"}

{"question": "What is Tourettes Syndrome?", "patient_answer": "It is a neurobiologic disorder in the brain that causes involuntary vocal tremors and tics.  It is migratory (ie: not usually the same tics all the time, they change).  It is lifelong and there is not a cure yet. \n\nThere are medications that can lessen the impact of the tics and make them less noticeable.  It takes time and patience to find the right combination, depending upon the severity of the Tourettes.  My son has Tourettes, accompanied by OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) and ADHD.  It is not uncommon to have Tourettes plus these conditions, or even others.\n\nThere has been a breakthrough at Harvard (see link below, click on Genetic Breakthrough) which is cause for hope.\n\nIf you have any questions about diagnosing Tourettes for yourself or a family  member or loved one, see a Neurologist.  I have learned that well meaning teachers, parents, pediatricians, nurses or others are not qualified to diagnose this disorder.  See a Pediatric Neurologist (if the person is under 16 or so) or a Neurologist.\n\nBest wishes to you.", "doctor_answer": "Cran has the definition correct. No one knows what causes Tourettes. My son has it, but it is not debilitating. Some think that it may be caused by early use of antibiotics.

In most countries, women must see a general practitioner first. If their condition requires knowledge or equipment unavailable to the GP, they are referred to a gynaecologist. However, in the United States, law and many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care, and some women select that option.\n\nAs in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history and examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, and that it involves special equipment -- the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus and ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. Virgins are not usually examined vaginally. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigations\nSome of the investigations used in gynaecology are:\n\nabdominal ultrasound, to give a low-power view of the pelvic organs. \nvaginal ultrasound. A probe is passed into the vagina, which allows a detailed view of the uterus and its contents. \nblood tests. Levels of hormones such as estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and progesterone are measured, as well as prolactin. \nhysteroscopy -- a fine tube is passed into the uterus via the cervix under a general anaesthetic. \nlaparoscopy -- tubes are passed into the peritoneal cavity, which is then insufflated with carbon dioxide. This is commonly used to diagnose endometriosis. \nMRI and CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare.

{"question": "What has been your best method for whitening your teeth?", "patient_answer": "Well,\n\nFirst you should wash out any rott or germs in your teeth with warm salt water, then you might want to consult with your dentist because some people have ways that work for them but trust me everyones teeth are differant. You should try flossing, brushing after every meal and remember to brush your gums for a healthier flow so you can`t get any cavities or gum rott. Don`t worry if your teeth bleed when you floss you probably just haven`t flossed enough, and remember to brush for atleast 2-3 minutes. If you want cleaner healthier teeth you also might want tobrush up and down and not side to side or circles.", "doctor_answer": "I used Crest whitestrips for a few months before my wedding and they did the job, but they gradually became stained again.

{"question": "What is the average weight of a 12 year old 5 foot girl..I think my cuz is too heavy??", "patient_answer": "Try using a BMI chart.  \n\nBMI is Used Differently with Children Than it is With Adults\nIn children and teens, body mass index is used to assess underweight, overweight, and risk for overweight. Children's body fatness changes over the years as they grow. Also, girls and boys differ in their body fatness as they mature. This is why BMI for children, also referred to as BMI-for-age, is gender and age specific.1, 2 BMI-for-age is plotted on gender specific growth charts. These charts are used for children and teens 2 – 20 years of age. For the 2000 CDC Growth Charts and Additional Information visit CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nEach of the CDC BMI-for-age gender specific charts contains a series of curved lines indicating specific percentiles. Healthcare professionals use the following established percentile cutoff points to identify underweight and overweight in children.\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/bmi-for-age.htm", "doctor_answer": "Well first off you really can't go by the charts tey use now because they are really outdated. So i wouldn't suggest using some kind of \"average weight\" to determine that. And you have to think about a lot of different factors. Ethnicity is one. Some ethnicities tend to be heavier than others. She may also have big bones (tho some people think that's a cop-out). And then there's genetics. If there are a lot of heavier people in her family then chances are she's gonna be heavier too no matter what she does. And then her metabolism also plays a factor. If her metabolism is slow then she's just gonna be heavier. But if she's only 5 feet tall then hopefully she's not TOO heavy. Because that could cause heart problems for her. But since she's twelve she's still growing so it may balance out for her."}
{"question": "Does anyone know the best way to lower blood sugar naturally?", "patient_answer": "According to the \"health gurus\", the biggest single thing you can do is start putting ground cinnamon into your food--the more, the merrier.", "doctor_answer": "When your blood sugar is high, and you are not taking any insulin (which is I assume is what you are doing), and then you exercise, you are actually making things much worse. Excercising while your sugar is high causes your body to produce ketones. Since you don't have any insulin on board, then your body begins to starve and breakdown fat for energy.

It was first identified in Serbia Montenegro in the early 1900s and is now known to exist worldwide. A strain of the H5N1-type of avian influenzavirus that emerged in 1997 has been identified as the most likely source of a future influenza pandemic and is known to have infected 133 people in Asia since late 2003, killing 68.[1]\n\nThe avian influenza subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human deaths, are: H1N1 caused Spanish flu, H2N2 caused Asian Flu, H3N2 caused Hong Kong Flu, H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, H7N2, H7N3.", "doctor_answer": "Bird Flu \nHundreds of thousands of birds in Asia died due to a virus that has been dubbed the \"bird flu.\" The highly contagious illness is responsible for wiping out large numbers of poultry in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. The particular strain of influenza which has been reported as causing the deaths is called H5N1. Humans can contract the disease through close contact with infected birds, or with the feces of infected birds. It is not known to spread through human-to-human contact. There has been no indication that humans would get the disease through eating eggs or meat of sick birds.\n\nThe only known way to eradicate the disease is by culling infected flocks. Thus far millions of chickens, ducks and other kinds of poultry have been culled in an effort to eliminate the virus. There have been several deaths due to the flu and the World Health Organization has expressed concern that the virus could latch on to a human influenza virus, potentially causing a serious epidemic. The bird flu's symptoms in humans include fever and coughing and eventual pneumonia."}

{"question": "what causes the hiccups?", "patient_answer": "A hiccup or hiccough (generally pronounced \"hiccup\" independent of the spelling) is an involuntary spasm of the diaphragm; typically this repeats several times a minute. The sudden rush of air into the lungs causes the glottis to close, creating the \"hic\" noise. A bout of hiccups generally resolves by itself, although many home remedies are in circulation to shorten the duration, and medication is occasionally necessary. By extension, the term \"hiccup\" is also used to describe a small and unrepeated aberration in an otherwise consistent pattern. The medical term is singultus.\n\nWhile many cases develop spontaneously, hiccups are known to develop often in specific situations, such as eating too quickly, taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal, eating very hot or spicy food, laughing vigorously or coughing, or drinking an excess of an alcoholic beverage. Hiccups may be caused by pressure to the phrenic nerve by other anatomical structures, or rarely by tumors.", "doctor_answer": "Irrition to your diaphragm causes hiccups. \n\nThe diaphragn pulls down when you inhale to help pull air into the lungs, and it pushes up when you exhale to help push air out of the lungs. \n\nBut when your diaphragm gets irritated it pushes up in a jerky way causing a hiccup."}

Although pot will undoubtedly have some withdrawal symptoms physiologically, they are likely to be subtle...perhaps a reduction of appetite or some mild headaches. The more obvious is likely to be psychological...most notably irritablility, social dysfunctions, personality changes in general, etc...\n\nIf they have made a concious effort to stop, then good for them, its never an easy thing to do and good support of sober people is a must.

{"question": "What should I do about chapped lips?", "patient_answer": "The first step in preventing chapped lips is to stop licking. Constant wetting and drying sucks the moisture from lips' outer layer, causing them to feel dry, which prompts more licking, creating a vicious cycle. Dehydrated lips are also more susceptible to dry, windy conditions. \n-- A moisturizing lip balm, especially those containing dimethicone, will help retain natural moisture and protect dry, chapped lips. \n-- Drinking lots of water will help prevent dehydration, which may contribute to chapped lips and dry skin. \n-- Smoothing a generous coating of lip balm on lips before bed will help to moisturize lips while you sleep. \n-- The sun's UV rays are responsible for 90 percent of visible damage we commonly attribute to aging. A lip balm that contains a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 will help prevent sunburn during outdoor activities, and may reduce the risks of skin aging, skin cancer, and other harmful effects of the sun. \n-- Regular lipstick products, especially some long-wearing varieties, may feel drying. A base coat of lip balm will add needed moisture during winter months. \n-- If lips become chapped, avoid wearing lipsticks while lips are recovering as drying products in color pigments may irritate chapped lips. Also keep acidic foods from touching delicate lips until they've healed. \n-- Lip exfoliators such as Softlips Nightly Care(TM) buff away dry, dead skin cells and stimulate growth of new, vibrant cells. The interactive Beta Hydroxy formula of Softlips Nightly Care(TM) conditions lips that may be sensitive to strong Alpha Hydroxy chemical peels, and the overnight system helps reduce concern about sun damage to freshly exfoliated skin. \n\nFor more information and tips, see the website below!", "doctor_answer": "MEDICATED CHAPSTICK, I PERFER BEES WAX OR BLISTIC, U KNOW ANYTHING LIKE THAT."}

Take someone with you -- task them with being sure all of your questions get asked and have them take notes. Don't hesitate to ask the doctor to slow down or provide more information. If you are interested in prognosis and treatment alternatives -- ask!

{"question": "does drinking a lot of water kill your appetite? how often should i drink it?", "patient_answer": "No. It doesn't.\n\nThough no single formula fits all people, several guidelines are available to help you estimate how much to drink each day. Delve into your daily fluid needs to learn how your body uses water and what factors may increase — or decrease — your water requirements.\n\nLack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry on normal functions. Even mild dehydration — as little as a 1 percent to 2 percent loss of your body weight — can sap your energy and make you tired. Dehydration poses a particular health risk for the very young and the very old. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include:\n\nExcessive thirst \nFatigue \nHeadache \nDry mouth \nLittle or no urination \nMuscle weakness \nDizziness \nLightheadedness \n\nEvery day you lose water through sweating — noticeable and unnoticeable — exhaling, urinating and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you need to replace this water by consuming beverages and foods that contain water. So how much water, or more precisely fluid, do you need?\n\nThis isn't an easy question to answer. A healthy adult's daily fluid intake can vary widely. Most people drink fluid to quench thirst, to supply perceived water needs and \"out of habit.\" At least three approaches estimate total fluid (water) needs for healthy, sedentary adults living in a temperate climate.\n\nReplacement approach. The average urine output for adults is 1.5 liters a day. You lose close to an additional liter of water a day through breathing, sweating and bowel movements. Food usually accounts for 20 percent of your fluid intake, so you if you consume 2 liters of water or other beverages a day (a little more than 8 cups), along with your normal diet, you can replace the lost fluids. \nEight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Another approach to water intake is the \"8 x 8 rule\" — drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day (about 1.9 liters). The rule could also be stated, \"drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day,\" as all fluids count toward the daily total. Though this approach isn't supported by scientific evidence, many people use this basic rule as a guideline for how much water and other fluids to drink. \nDietary recommendations. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day and women consume 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages a day. These guidelines are based on national food surveys that assessed people's average fluid intakes.", "doctor_answer": "I have to disagree with most of the people I guess. Drinking cold water does suppress appetite because it sits in your stomach longer and makes you feel fuller. Your stomach has to heat it up before your body can process it, so it can trick your stomach into curbing the urge for munchies."}
{"question": "why do i have headaches everyday?", "patient_answer": "If your Doctor said that it is not migrains then it is probably tension headaches.  This is cause by contraction of some of the back muscles related to stress such as Trapezius, semispinalis capitits, splenious capitis etc.. Basically this tension that most probably is triggered by some sort of stress puts pressure on a spinal nerve coming out of the spinal cord that inhibits the optimum potential of your body to function properly.. Chiropractic uses a non invasive procedure to remove that nerve interference and permit the body to function in harmony without obstruction.. Chiropractic is proven and documented by peer reviewed journals to be effective with patients that have headaches.. What you don't want to do is rely on medication because your body will adapt to the chemicals and you'll always have to take them to feel normal..

{"question": "how can I ensure that a part of my body gets suffecient blood?", "patient_answer": "Generally there are 2 reasons why a part of your body might lack blood, physical and chemical.  Physical reasons might be that the part of your body may be too tight to allow for good circulation.  In this case, you must stretch (eg. yoga or pilates) and exercise to loosen up that area.  Doing heat pack will also help to aid the blood flow temporarily.  One important thing to remember though is that the source of tightness might be completely unexpected.  If you have cold hands, it may be more helpful to stretch your calves or your shoulders depending on your body structure rather than the hand itself.  You must remember to treat your body as a whole.  Chemical reasons could come from your diet or the air you breathe or any other intake (eg. tobacco or drugs).  This could alter the chemical make up of your bloodstream.  In this case, what you would have to do is to remove the chemical that is causing the problem.

{"question": "Would I have had a herpes outbreak by now??", "patient_answer": "I say you get off the internet and get checked out you may have something more serious than herpes with a fever and diarhea. Drs. have to be confidential about your problem so go out of town if your scared someone will see you at the clinic.", "doctor_answer": "It can take up to two to three weeks for herpes to erupt with physical lesions after being infected, so it is possibly too soon to have an outbreak.  However everyone responds differently to herpes in the initial infection phase, and some people never break out (about 25%), and many only have very mild symptoms, yet they are contagious (called asymptomatic viral shedding).  So even if you don't see an outbreak, that doesn't mean you don't have herpes.  If you had contact with someone who you think might have had herpes, you should get tested as soon as you do see any kind of lesion, where they can sample the fluid directly and test it for herpes virus.  If you don't break out, you need to wait about 8 to 12 weeks from the time you were exposed to get a blood test done for herpes antibodies.  It will tkae that long for your body to produce a detectable level with high certainty.  Be sure to get an antibody test for both herpes 1 and 2, that tests for IgM antibodies.  The standard in this case is a test called the the HerpeSelect antibody test."}

{"question": "why do we fart?", "patient_answer": "QUOTE: \"Well, for starters, the gas that makes up a fart comes from two sources: more originates from the breakdown of food by the digestive system, and some is from swallowed air. In the first case, foodstuffs are broken down by enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria in order for the energy in them to be made available to the body. Through the processes of digestion and fermentation, gases can be liberated from what's eaten. In the second case, air that a person swallows from eating, drinking, breathing, chewing gum, and being stressed, among other ways of entry, that's not expelled during a burp travels through the stomach and intestine, transforming into fart-ready mode. In either case, the gases flow down through the rest of the digestive tract and eventually exit the body - Poof! Ping! Pfft! Toot-toot! Kaboom! - expelled as a fart, or farts. And this silent or noisy expulsion of air can help bring about some relief and comfort from a buildup of gas within the lower part of the body.\"", "doctor_answer": "What exactly is a fart? The word \"fart\" can stand for: Frequency Actuated Rectal Tremor. Farting, also known as flatulence, is the act of passing intestinal gas from the butt. Intestinal gas comes from several sources: air we swallow, gas that seeps into our intestines from our blood, gas produced by chemical reactions in our guts, and gas produced by bacteria living in our guts. Burps are not farts that come out your mouth. They have to do with your stomach."}

{"question": "Do I need a counselor...?", "patient_answer": "It is very difficult to change the behaviors of others. It is much more effective to think about why this bothers you so much, and to change the way you feel about and react to their arguing. Family counseling might not be a bad idea if your other family members agree that this is a problem and are interested in changing. But counseling does not work unless those involved have a legitimate interest in changing themselves. I suggest calmly discussing with your family how much of a problem this is for them, and find out if they are interested in changing THEMSELVES rather than changing OTHERS.

{"question": "what are the important effects of greeg tea?", "patient_answer": "All tea comes from the same plant--black, green, and oolong teas all have the same parents. The difference in the teas lies in how the teas are prepared after picking. Black and oolong tea are fermented, but Green tea is not. Therefore the active constituents remain unaltered in green tea. The most important ingredient in green tea is the phytonutrient eppigallocatchin or EGCG for short. This substance is a polyphenolic compound that acts as an antioxidant.\n\nWhat does EGCG do?\nResearch has shown that these polyphenolic antioxidants protects the body against cardiovascular disease, and promote a healthy immune system. However in this new research, Professor Roger Thornley in England states, “We have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme DHFR or dihydrofolate which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs. This is the first time to our knowledge a known target for an anti-cancer drug has been identified as being inhibited by EGCG.” The scientist continued by saying that EGCG is probably just one of a number of anti-cancer mechanisms in green tea.\n\nIt's also said to help reduce bad Cholestrol among many other help benefits which are still being researched. You will find several books and online claims about green tea - most of them are true but not all of them have been published in scientific journals yet because enough research has not been done yet.\n\nIn short - it's good for you!", "doctor_answer": "as oppossed to coffee, green tea has an alkalizing affect on the body whereas coffee is acidic. our typical diet is all ready too acidic. \njust about anything green/fruits/vegetables  helps us this way. Green tea also has a lot of antioxidants"}

That way you know there are no conflicting interests.\n\nSometimes a lump is just a lump.  Breasts get lumpy during certain times of the month, and goes along with normal cycles.  Calcifications and shadowing are pretty routine findings as well.  If there was something to be concerned about, the first doc would have ordered a biopsy on the lump.  A biopsy is where a needle is inserted into the lump and a sample is taken to be studied, to determine whether it is cancerous."}

{"question": "what is an aflatoxin?", "patient_answer": "PROPERTIES OF AFLATOXIN AND IT PRODUCING FUNGI\n\n\nReddy,S.V. and Farid Waliyar \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMany agricultural commodities are vulnerable to attack by a group of fungi that are able to produce toxic metabolites called mycotoxins. Among various mycotoxins, aflatoxins have assumed significance due to their deleterious effects on human beings, poultry and livestock. The aflatoxin problem was first recognized in 1960, when there was severe outbreak of a disease referred as \"Turkey 'X' Disease\" in UK, in which over 100,000 turkey poults were died. The cause of the disease was shown due to toxins in peanut meal infected with Aspergillus flavus and the toxins were named as aflatoxins.\n\nNatural occurrence:\n\nFood products contaminated with aflatoxins include cereal (maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, wheat), oilseeds (groundnut, soybean, sunflower, cotton), spices (chillies, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, zinger), tree nuts (almonds, pistachio, walnuts, coconut) and milk. \n\nPhysical and chemical properties:\n\nAflatoxins are potent toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunosuppressive agents, produced as secondary metabolites by the fungus Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus on variety of food products. Among 18 different types of aflatoxins identified, major members are aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is normally predominant in amount in cultures as well as in food products. Pure AFB1 is pale-white to yellow crystalline, odorless solid. Aflatoxins are soluble in methanol, chloroform, actone, acetonitrile. A. flavus typically produces AFB1 and AFB2, where as A. parasiticus produce AFG1 and AFG2 as well as AFB1 and AFB2. Four other aflatoxins M1, M2, B2A, G2A which may be produced in minor amounts were subsequently isolated from cultures of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A number of closely related compounds namely aflatoxin GM1, parasiticol and aflatoxicol are also produced by A. flavus. Aflatoxin M1and M2 are major metabolites of aflatoxin B1 and B2 respectively, found in milk of animals that have consumed feed contaminated with aflatoxins.", "doctor_answer": "Aflatoxins are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus; but most notably Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic to animals, including humans. After entering the body, aflatoxins are metabolized by the liver to an intermediate reactive, aflatoxin M1, an epoxide."}

{"question": "What is Citrus Naringin and how does it affect the human body?", "patient_answer": "It is a natural chemical compound known as a bioflavanoid found in grapefruit, giving it its bitter flavor.\nThis powerful bioflavonoid has antioxidant and antifungal properties, and as such may help prevent cancer and atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries), as well as a number of other ailments.\n\nNaringin also works synergistically with other nutrients, increasing the bio-availability (how much nutrient is absorbed by the body) and therefore maximizing the health benefits of these nutrients.\n\nIt is important to note this citrus extract interferes with enzyme activity in the intestines, and therefore can inhibit the breakdown of certain drugs. That is why you should consult with your physician if you are on any medication before eating grapefruit.", "doctor_answer": "It is a fruit extract.

{"question": "Is it dangerous to get in a tanning bed while your pregnant?", "patient_answer": "While there is no evidence that a fetus is affected by its mothers' exposure to either the natural sun or indoor tanning equipment, a potential drawback to tanning during pregnancy may be the risk of the woman's body overheating. Pregnant women are cautioned to avoid prolonged sauna and whirlpool exposure due to the possible harm to the fetus from the rise in the woman's core body temperature. Core body temperature is the temperature of the blood as it is pumped from the heart, which normally ranges from 99 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Extended periods of sauna or whirlpool exposures or prolonged vigorous exercise may actually cause this temperature to rise. This rise in body temperature could result in developmental damage or possibly death to the fetus.", "doctor_answer": "I've heard both points of view, but MOST doctors just recommend staying away from it while pregnant.

{"question": "I have a soar throat and mouth ulcer now, it is there for a week now. Any natural way or home ideas?", "patient_answer": "I recently answered a similar question but only dealing with sore throat.  The best natural method I am familiar with is licorice.  A double clinical study of patients with nonspecific sore throat tested licorice tea (throat coat brand) and found a significant reduction in throat pain as compared with placebo in as little as 10 minutes.  Patients were told to consume this tea 4-6 times per day.\n\nLicorice tea will probably also help with the pain of the mouth sore, even if it does not make the sore heal faster, but it might help with that too.\n\nLicorice has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, which may help with the blister.\n\nOne warning, though,  is that you should not consume too much licorice, especially if you have blood pressure problems.

{"question": "What is multiple sclerosis?", "patient_answer": "Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). \nMultiple sclerosis (MS) usually affects woman more than men. The disorder most commonly begins between ages 20 and 40, but can strike at any age.\n\nThe exact cause is not known, but MS is believed to result from damage to the myelin sheath, the protective material which surrounds nerve cells. It is a progressive disease, meaning the damage gets worse over time. Inflammation destroys the myelin, leaving multiple areas of scar tissue (sclerosis). The inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system.\n\nThe inflammation causes nerve impulses to slow down or become blocked, leading to the symptoms of MS. Repeated episodes, or flare ups, of inflammation can occur along any area of the brain and spinal cord.\n\nSymptoms vary because the location and extent of each attack varies. Usually episodes that last days, weeks, or months alternate with times of reduced or no symptoms (remission).\n\nRecurrence (relapse) is common although non-stop progression without periods of remission may also occur.\n\nResearchers are not sure what triggers an attack. Patients with MS typically have a higher number of immune cells than a healthy person, which suggests that an immune response might play a role. The most common theories point to a virus or genetic defect, or a combination of both. There also appears to be a genetic link to the disease. MS is more likely to occur in northern Europe, the northern United States, southern Australia, and New Zealand than in other areas. Geographic studies indicate there may be an environmental factor involved.\n\nPeople with a family history of MS and those who live in a geographical area with a higher incidence rate for MS have a higher risk of the disease.\n\nCheck out this article with excellent illustrations:\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000737.htm", "doctor_answer": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the Central Nervous System (CNS) - that's the brain and spinal cord. Predominantly, it is a disease of the \"white matter\" tissue. The white matter is made up of nerve fibres which are responsible for transmitting communication signals both internally within the CNS and between the CNS and the nerves supplying rest of the body."}
{"question": "how does injections of haldol or prolixin help treat bipolar disorder?", "patient_answer": "Haldol and prolixin are antipsychotic drugs, also formerly known as \"major tranquilizers\".

These drugs will calm any kind of agitation or excitement, such as the mania of a bipolar (manic depressive).  These drugs make you like a zombie.  You may still be awake, but your emotions are paralyzed.  There is no special effect on manic depressives. These drugs should not be used without strong reason to do so, as they can cause permanant neurological impairment, called Tardive Dyskinesia, where a person has involuntary movements usually of his mouth and face, even tounge.

{"question": "what is thephysiology of thirst?", "patient_answer": "Thirst and drinking function to maintain body water balance and are basic to survival. Thirst is often associated with a dry unpleasant-tasting mouth and the feeling of a need to obtain water; it can result from dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, pharmacologic agents, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids. Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid. Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers. Although nurses are commonly confronted with client complaints of thirst, there has been minimal nursing research that relates to assessment of thirst and drinking behaviors, nursing diagnoses for thirst, or nursing interventions for persons with altered thirst or drinking behaviors.\n\nThirst is the sensation indicating the body's need for water. Dry or salty food and dry, dusty air may induce such a sensation by depleting moisture in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Relief through ingestion of water is only temporary, however, if thirst results from a generalized depletion of water in the system. About three fourths of the body is composed of fluids, and the average adult requires 21/2 qt (2.4 liters) of fluid per day, supplied by water, other beverages, and foods. Depriving the body of water interferes with its metabolism and functions, causing dehydration, which is eventually fatal. The unnatural thirst that accompanies fever, diabetes, and other disorders is caused by a rapid reduction of the body fluids. The sensation of thirst is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus in the brain. Dehydration of the cells triggers the posterior pituitary to releast the antidiuretic hormone (ADH).", "doctor_answer": "To put it simply, you loose water, it concentrates your blood and your brain detects this concentration (osmolality) and sends a signal to drink and to also limit excretion of water.  Its caused by the salt concentration of our blood as sensed by the brain.  IF you are thirsty, you are 1% dehyradted."}

{"question": "What is the main cause of Nephrotic Syndrome?", "patient_answer": "Nephrotic syndrom is the end result of a variety of diseases that damage the capillaries of the glomerulus (the place where urine formation begins.) Factors causing NS include any disorder that may affect the glomerulus, including immunologic disorders, toxic injury to the kidneys, neoplasms, metabolic abnormalities, infections, and diseases of the vascular system. Causes are classified according to the changes found in the capillaries of the glomerulus when examined by electron microscopy. Clinically, NS leads to the loss of a large amount of protein in the urine, which in turn leads to edema (fluid retention). Adrenal cortical steroids have a dramatic immediate effect on the condition but their use does not alter the survival rate.", "doctor_answer": "Many conditions and diseases can cause nephrotic syndrome, including:\nDiabetes and lupus. Diabetes is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults in the United States. 2 \nInfections, such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.\nCancer, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and Hodgkin's lymphoma.\nMedications, including certain anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen. \nIllegal drugs, such as heroin.\nConditions such as preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related condition; graft rejection following an organ transplant; and allergic reactions to bee stings.\nUnknown factors."}

{"question": "how can i tell if im going through menopause?", "patient_answer": "Perimenopause (and later, menopause itself) is not an illness, but a natural process in a woman’s body. Your symptoms, like night sweats, irregular periods, vaginal dryness, and menopause insomnia, are just indicators of underlying hormonal imbalances or metabolic damage from poor nutrition, stress and other factors.\n\nMenopause:\n    * Irregular periods. Your menstrual periods may stop suddenly, or gradually get lighter or heavier and then stop. The unpredictability of your periods may be your first clue that menopause is approaching.\n    * Decreased fertility. When ovulation begins to fluctuate, you're less likely to become pregnant. Until you haven't had a period for a year, however, pregnancy is still possible.\n    * Vaginal and urinary changes. As your estrogen level declines, the tissues lining your vagina and urethra — the opening to your bladder — become drier, thinner and less elastic. With decreased lubrication you may experience burning or itching, along with increased risk of infections of your urinary tract or vagina. These changes may make sexual intercourse uncomfortable or even painful. You may feel the need to urinate more frequently or more urgently, and you may experience urinary incontinence.\n    * Hot flashes. As your estrogen level drops, your blood vessels may expand rapidly, causing your skin temperature to rise. This can lead to a feeling of warmth that moves upward from your chest to your shoulders, neck and head. You may sweat, and as the sweat evaporates from your skin, you may feel chilled, weak and slightly faint. Your face might look flushed, and red blotches may appear on your chest, neck and arms. Most hot flashes last from 30 seconds to several minutes, although they can last much longer. The frequency, as well as the duration, of hot flashes varies from person to person. You may have them once every hour or only occasionally. They can occur any time during the day or night. They may be a part of your life for a year or more, or you may never have them.\n    * Sleep disturbances and night sweats. Night sweats are often a consequence of hot flashes. You may awaken from a sound sleep with soaking night sweats followed by chills. You may have difficulty falling back to sleep or achieving a deep, restful sleep. Lack of sleep may affect your mood and overall health.\n    * Changes in appearance. Many women gain a modest amount of weight — about 5 pounds on average — during the menopausal transition. The fat that once was concentrated in your hips and thighs may settle above your waist and in your abdomen. You may notice a loss of fullness in your breasts, thinning hair and wrinkles in your skin. If you previously experienced adult acne, it may become worse. Although your estrogen level drops, your body continues to produce small amounts of the male hormone testosterone. As a result, you may develop coarse hair on your chin, upper lip, chest and abdomen.\n    * Emotional and cognitive changes. You may experience irritability, fatigue, decreased memory and diminished concentration as you approach menopause. These symptoms have sometimes been attributed to hormonal fluctuations. Yet other factors are more likely to contribute to these changes, including sleep deprivation and stressful life events — such as the illness or death of a parent, grown children leaving home or returning home, and retirement.", "doctor_answer": "all the men  stop and stare at you"}

{"question": "if i have Chlamydia does my partner have to have it too?", "patient_answer": "If you test positive for chlamydia, your infection can be cured with antibiotics. Depending on several factors, your health care professional may prescribe azithromycin, in which case you will take only a single dose, or you may be prescribed doxycycline, which requires one pill twice a day for seven days. This may be followed by a test to see if you are cured, but test of cure is not routine and is usually reserved for pregnant women or individuals with persisting or new symptoms. Penicillin is not considered as effective against chlamydia as azithromycin. \n\nIf you are pregnant and infected with chlamydia, you still can be treated without harming the fetus. However, doxycycline is not recommended for pregnant women. The recommended regimen for pregnant women is erythromycin or amoxicillin for seven days, yet azithromycin as a single dose is also a possible option and recent studies and expert opinions suggest it is safe and effective. As with any antibiotic treatment, it is important that you take all your pills, even after symptoms disappear. \n\nBecause treatment with doxycycline or azithromycin is highly effective, women usually do not need retesting for chlamydia after treatment unless their symptoms persist or reinfection is suspected. Too often, women become reinfected because their partner has not been treated as well. Studies have shown that women who are reinfected with chlamydia have a much greater risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Therefore, it is important that you abstain from sexual contact until your partner has been tested and completed treatment, meaning seven days after a single-dose azithromycin regimen or after completion of a seven-day doxycycline regimen. \n\nIn general, treatment is recommended for any partner or partners you had sexual contact with up to 60 days prior to having symptoms or a diagnosis of chlamydia. Some clinics are experimenting with what is called partner-delivered therapy. Patients are given a one-gram dose of azithromycin to give to their partner. There are legal and ethical debates about this approach but in some cases it may be the most effective way to stop the spread of chlamydia, because many infected male partners have no symptoms and are reluctant to seek treatment. Penicillin is not considered as effective against chlamydia as azithromycin or doxycycline. \n\nPID treatment begins with an antibiotic regimen that provides broad coverage against several different bacteria. Treatment should begin as soon as a diagnosis is made, because immediate therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of long-term consequences of PID. Studies are under way to determine whether oral therapy is as effective as parenteral (intravenous) therapy. There are several different treatment options recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Regardless of which type of therapy is chosen, hospitalization is no longer recommended, except in certain circumstances including: \n\nsurgery is needed\n\nthe patient is pregnant\n\nan oral outpatient regimen cannot be tolerated\n\na patient does not respond clinically to oral antimicrobial therapy \n\na patient has severe illness, including high fever, nausea and vomiting\n\na patient has tubo-ovarian abscess or a weakened immune system\n\nWhile medication can stop PID, some women may need surgery to remove scar tissue and blockages caused by long-term infection. The most common type of surgery involves laparoscopy.", "doctor_answer": "more than likely but sometimes its not the case. i had a friend that had it she had 3 freaky partners two were just flings and the other on was serious. the two freaky partners didnt have it but her seious on did. the only way to be sure is by getting it checked out and dealing with it."}

{"question": "Does going out in the cold cause a cold?", "patient_answer": "Hey here hope this helps, this is from the source, check out the full article.\n\"scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a division of the National Institutes of Health, have shown that exposure to cold temperatures does not influence the development or severity of a cold. This means that if a person is exposed to a cold virus but isn't necessarily showing symptoms, exposure to cold temperature doesn't make a difference as to whether this person gets sick or how sick this person will become. \n\nStill, most colds occur during the fall and winter months, when schools begin to open and the mercury begins to fall. While cold temperatures do not cause colds, the colder months of the year seem to be more conducive to infection or transmission. This is probably due to many factors, including: \n\n>lower humidity \n>schools are in session \n>people spend more time indoors and in closer quarters \n>The cold season corresponds to the colder months of the year, which are also those with lower humidity. This absence of moisture may affect the number of infections as the most common cold-causing viruses thrive in lower humidity. What's more, dry air can dry the mucous lining of the nasal passages, making it more open to viral infection.\"", "doctor_answer": "Going out into the cold weather has no effect on the spread of a cold. The reason that there appears to be a relationship is that people spend more time indoors during the cold winter weather. In fact, however, it is the proximity to other people rather than the temperature outside that seems to be the culprit. For this same reason, children in daycare or kindergarten are particularly prone to having colds."}

My best advise is make sure to get plenty of sleep, take a multiple vitamin, keep active in at least low impact sports, and consider Magnesium and Malic Acid supplements (consult the doctor or a nutritionist to have your Magnesuim level checked- it is a simpe mouth swab and not painful), meditation does help some in keeping the pain back if you can seperate your mind from the pain, and try to take 2-3 warm Epson Salt baths a week (Epson salt contains Magnesium and soaking in a warm tub of it helps to get the mineral into the body. Magnesium aids the muscles in using oxygen and when the level is low which is typical in Fibro it can cause are cramps, spasms, and pain.) Also, Fibromyalgia is a neurotransmitter disorder certain foods can trigger similiar symptoms to Fibro. Try eliminating Monsodium Glutamate from your diet. I did and some of my symptoms (chronic headaches and nausea) went away. It is in everything from Doritos to chicken soup. A few key finding's of an FDA study found MSG to cause a \"burning sensation in the back of the neck, forearms and chest\". Otherwise, learn your limits and pace yourself.\nGood luck!", "doctor_answer": "One way I have learned to help with pain that is temporary but is good for the body is aquatic therapy. the water is between 88-90 degrees and when you get in you begin to feel the stress and pain dissolve while in the water. Heating pads or throws are also a good thing to use when it is cold. I just recently bought a heated mattress pad for our bed. it has helped me. I also have read that tai chi can be another good way to help."}

{"question": "if u trim ur pubic hair r u suppose to itch?", "patient_answer": "i am guessing if you have to ask, this is one of the first times you have shaven down there, you might have done a bad job of it, tiny little cuts itch you know, good soap helps, keeping it dry, the hair might be growing back, or your underwear is too tight, no whity tighties, try boxers", "doctor_answer": "If you are using a razor, then you will get skin irritation. Using an elecric shaver can help but some people have really sensative skin and that can still cause irritaion. \nThe best way is buying a personal shaver. They sell them real cheap at your local drug store. Put the guard on. The guard is the black thing that you place at the razor to determine the closeness of the shave. And begin shaving.

{"question": "Is it normal to bruise easily when you are taking blood thinners?", "patient_answer": "Hi there! I'm not a doctor, but I'd be glad to help you. People with thin blood do tend to bruise easier.

Try to aviod sitting on one side for a long time,etc. If your having other side effects contact your doctor.", "doctor_answer": "It is normal.  Blood thinners disrupt the body's clotting mechanism, so even the smallest bumps - things you may not realize happen, even rolling over in your sleep - can cause minor bruising.  Of course excessive bruising could be a sign that your blood is too thin (e.g., you may have a higher dose of anticoagulants than you need).  If you're doing this under a doctor's supervision, you might ask him about it.  If you're not, it's a good idea to speak with your physician just to be sure he's okay with this therapy."}

{"question": "If I do not have high BP but Do have diabetes, why must I still be careful of sodium intake?", "patient_answer": "Think about this one for a moment. Diabetes results when your body cannot use the glucose that is in your blood. The result is a high blood glucose concentration level in your blood. One of the ways you can ease high blood sugar (along with insulin, of course) is to drink lots of water. If you are well-hydrated, then there is not as much glucose in your blood relative to your overall blood volume. Sodium causes a restriction of the blood vessels; which in turn \"thickens\" the blood, and makes your blood glucose concentrations higher!", "doctor_answer": "High blood pressure often goes hand in hand with Diabetes. I am sure your physician is limiting your sodium intake in order to cut down on your chances of developing medication-dependent hypertension at some point."}

{"question": "Is it really worth buying and trying Crest White Strips for whitening teeth?", "patient_answer": "Yes, and, actually, the Crest White Strips Premium are worth the extra money.  For some reason, they don't make your teeth as sensitive during the whitening process.\n\nOne thing that you have to keep in mind is that you have to find the time to use the product.  You have to keep the strips on for 30 minutes at a time, twice a day.  I usually did this before I went to work in the morning, and after I got home, before I went out again.  But it's kindof hard to commit to if you have a really busy schedule.\n\nMy uncle is an orthodontist and told me that if you have really sensitive teeth, Crest White Strips are still safe to use.  Just because they cause pain doesn't mean they're harming you, they're just making your teeth sensitive during the whitening process.\n\nHappy smiles!", "doctor_answer": "Yes...they work great.  I drink coffee and red wine on a regular basis and people always tell me how white my teeth are."}
{"question": "Has anyone ever had \"Ear Candling\" done\"?", "patient_answer": "I tried eal candling a few years ago and worked very. I can hear better. It removed the excess wax from my ears. By the way it does not hurt.", "doctor_answer": "Ear candles are a scam. The way it's described as working is pure bull. It's supposed to work by creating a gentle vacuum to pull out any wax in your ears. Yes, a flame will create a vacuum, but not if it's open to air. It needs to be enclosed. If you enclose an ear candle, you'll end up popping your eardrum.\n\nPlease try these experiments.\n\nTake a large sandwich bag and blow it up with your mouth so that it looks like a balloon. Now use your mouth to suck out all the air. That's what a collapsed bag looks like. Remember what it looks like.\n\nNow blow up the bag again. Put the small end of the candle into the bag's opening and light the candle. If it's supposed to create a vacuum effect, the plastic bag should completely collapse like when you sucked out the air with your mouth. Do you get the same effect? I didn't think so.\n\n\nAs for removing excess wax from your ears, the stuff you see at the bottom of the candle is not ear wax. It's just the ash from the candle. If you don't believe me, try candling your ear and see how much material comes out. Next, put one of those ear candles into a cup and burn it. You'll notice that the same amount of material will show up at the bottom of the candle. Are you telling me that the candle pulled ear wax out of a cup?\n\n\nThe candles work through a psychosomatic effect. It's similar to someone taking a sugar pill and actually feeling better because they believe it. I suppose the heat would also make your ears feel better, but it's not a real solution if you have an ear infection or other disease.\n\n\nDon't waste your money. If your ear hurts, see a doctor. It could be an ear infection. If you have excess wax, go to your local pharmacy and pick up some ear wax removal drops."}

Each woman's fertility is unique.  It may take time for fertility to return after using depo provera or any hormonal birth control.  If you want to get pregnant, it may take some time for your cycles to go back to \"normal.\"  However, if you do not want to get pregnant, the best thing to do is use another form of birth control.\n\nYou may become fertile any time after 12 weeks after your most recent depo shot.  No one can tell you when.  Remember that your period starts 2 weeks (14 days) after the ovaries release an egg.  There is no way to know in advance when ovulation will happen for sure.  Because sperm can stay alive inside the woman's body for up to 7 days, pregnancy can happen fairly easily.  The shot itself is over 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy during its estimated three month period.\n\nIf you don't get your period by 16 weeks since your last depo shot, and you have had unprotected sex, you may want a pregnancy test. You can get an over the counter pregnancy test at any drug store.  They are quite reliable. There are also several clinics that offer free pregnancy tests.  Best,\n\n`k."}

While your dreaming in REM, your bodies muscle are all paralyzed (so you don't act your dreams out), this includes those that allow blood flow for an erection. The early part of your night will have short REM periods, but they get longer as the night goes on. Most people will be in close proximity to a very long REM period when they wake up in the morning...thus with an erection.\n\nOn a side note, an old school method to test for physiological vs psychological impotence was to wrap and secure the penis with several stamps on a roll before bed. In the course of the night, if a man was physiologically able to maintain an erection he would do so during REM sleep and break the perferations on the stamp roll. In the morning you had a diagnosis.", "doctor_answer": "It's normal to get one roughly 3 times every night if you sleep a full 8 hours.  That tissue is among the most poorly oxygenated in the body, and some believe that this is why erections are part of a regular sleep cycle.

{"question": "Can i transfer hpv to another person?", "patient_answer": "Fifth's disease, or erythema infectiosa, has been recognized much more in the past few years. We now know that it is caused by the human parvo virus B19-3. It is called Fifth's disease after four more common viral rash illnesses seen in children which are measles, scarlet fever, rubella and scarlatina. The Sixth's disease is roseola. Fifth's disease virus, or human parvo virus B19, is attracted to rapidly dividing cells in the body. Therefore people with weak immune systems and with weak red blood cells are at high risk. This includes people with sickle cell disease, hereditary spirochaetosis, any serious immune disease or cancer, and AIDS. It also might include someone with recurrent blood loss and anemia. In these patients, a very severe with profound anemia and a very severe disease without the typical rash. These patients obviously need the care of an experienced physician and frequently a hematologist.\n\nFor the majority of patients, however, Fifths disease is a mild viral infection which starts with typical cold\n\nlike symptoms in adults and sometimes vague muscle aches and headache. This is the time in which the patient is actually contagious and the virus is multiplying in the body. After a few days, the virus clears and antibodies to the virus cause a classic rash in the skin. In adults, there is usually some joint swelling and tenderness. In children the rash is a slightly raised, bright red patch over the facial cheeks with some clearing directly around the mouth. Also present is a lacy pink to red rash scattered over the extremities and trunk. Usually palms and soles are spared. About 50% of the time, the rash itches. The rash seems to fade and come back whenever the child is stressed or exposed to a lot of sun or overheating. In older adolescents and adults, the rash may not appear as the typical rash seen in children.\n\nThe predominant symptoms seen in up to 60% of adults is joint swelling usually the wrist, hands or ankles. This may last for up to a few weeks but does not cause any permanent changes and does not cause rheumatoid arthritis. The joint symptoms are only found in about 3% of children up to age nine. Again, most children will acquire Fifth's disease at some time in their life and most adults, when tested for antibodies show evidence of having had it sometime in their life. The risk to a pregnant woman is considered about .6% and should be taken into account since a growing fetus does have both a weak immune system and rapidly dividing red cells and is, therefore, susceptible to the virus. It is not recommended that children with Fifth's disease be excluded from school because by the time the rash appears, they are actually not contagious. It is also not recommended that pregnant women be excluded from day care or other work situations because of the relative low risk to them. They should be aware, however, of any epidemics taking place and use good hand washing as a means of decreasing the spread of the virus. There is presently no vaccine but there is some experimental evidence that IV gamma globulin may help in high risk patients; however it is not presently recommended for routine patients. Infants of mothers who contract parvo virus B19 in early pregnancy are at risk for severe blood loss but do not develop birth defects. In cases where the diagnosis is picked up there have been fetal blood exchanges done and the infants have been saved through this procedure. Obviously this is something that would require a sophisticated medical center and a team of perinatologists and obstetrician.", "doctor_answer": "yes you can but only if your infected skin touches someone else's skin"}
{"question": "what is proteolytic enzyme tablets?", "patient_answer": "I assume you are talking about something like Pancrease which is a pill that contains the normal proteolytic enzymes that are released by your pancreas to aid in digestion.  They cleave bonds  in protein to make more simple molecules that your intestines can absorb and are usually prescribed for people that have inadequate pancreas function.", "doctor_answer": "Proteases (proteinases, peptidases or proteolytic enzymes) are enzymes that break peptide bonds between amino acids of proteins. The process is called proteolytic cleavage, a common mechanism of activation or inactivation of enzymes especially involved in blood coagulation or digestion. They use a molecule of water for this and are thus classified as hydrolases.\n\n\nClassification\nThere are currently six classes of proteases:\n\nSerine proteases \nThreonine proteases \nCysteine proteases \nAspartic acid proteases (e. g. plasmepsin) \nMetalloproteases \nGlutamic acid proteases \n\nThe threonine and glutamic peptidases were not described until 1995 and 2004, respectively. The mechanism used to cleave a peptide bond involves making an amino acid residue (serine, cystein and threonine peptidases) or a water molecule (aspartic, metallo and glutamic peptidases) nucleophilic so that it can attack the peptide carbonyl group. One way to make a nucleophile is by a catalytic triad, where a histidine residue is used to activate serine, cysteine or threonine as a nucleophile.\n\n\nOccurrence\nProteases occur naturally in all organisms and constitute 1-5% of the gene content. These enzymes are involved in a multitude of physiological reactions from simple digestion of food proteins to highly regulated cascades (e.g. the blood clotting cascade, the complement system and the invertebrate prophenoloxidase activating cascade). Peptidases can break either specific peptide bonds (limited proteolysis), depending on the amino acid sequence of a protein, or break down a complete peptide to amino acids (unlimited proteolysis). The activity can be a destructive change abolishing a protein's function or digesting it to its principal components, it can be an activation of a function or it can be a signal in a signalling pathway."}

I still have a \"clunk\" in my left hip, which may cause issues later in life, but now, in my 30's I have no major issues.\n\nCheck now!!", "doctor_answer": "The most common scenario is the pediatrician detecting a \"hip click\" during routine post-natal checkup. Actually, a \"clunk\", rather than a \"click\" is detected in the unstable hip, but it requires experience to tell a \"clunk\" from a \"click\". The pediatrician typically does the Ortolani test by spreading the thighs, or the Barlow test by bringing the knees together, to elicit this finding.\n\nIn the older infant, the pediatrician may suspect the problem if the child has tight hip adductors - he has a hard time spreading the baby’s hips. He may also notice that the skin creases around the groin or the buttocks are not symmetrical. Or the legs may appear to be of different lengths.\n\nAt age one, the affected child may present with a limp. Unfortunately, pain is not a problem in the child, hence it is easy to miss the diagnosis. However, by the time the patient becomes an adult, arthritic changes will occur, and pain will set in."}

{"question": "can stress kill you?", "patient_answer": "How much stress and of what kind?  Heat stress as well as extreme cold can kill.  Emotional stress can lower the immune system leading to illness and possibly death.  On the other hand a little stress is good for you.  Exercise is a form of stress that keeps you fit.  Mental stress (Will I fail?) may inspire you to study hard and survive the test.\n\nStress often involves the human fight and flight reaction, releasing lots of adrenalin (ever feel the hairs on your neck rise - perhaps a barking dog right behind you?  in a dark alley?).  Ancient man had to tackle a different set of problems than we do today.  Do I stand and fight the saber-toothed tiger or flee?  Adrenalin helped with either decision (but not much with the tiger battle).  A great deal of activity, kicking or running, then burned off the excess adrenalin.\n\nToday, when we get angry say at a red traffic light, we build up the adrenalin but just sit there and steem without burning it off.  And that can harm the cardiovascular system (which includes the heart).\n\nYou have a choice.

{"question": "Why does a specific treatment for a diseased condition work for one person and not another?", "patient_answer": "Our micro biology minor gave the best answer...I would like to add that the same disease may present itself differently in people.  Also, the general health and lifestyle of a person may be a major factor in treatment.  If a person has a chronic disease such as diabetes, or has allergies to certain antibiotics, or has cancer, a series of different treatments for their chronic disease may be needed over time, or if a secondary disease to the chronic disease is a problem, may need a different treatment than a healthy person would need.  Just as people have subtle differences....so too diseases....There are some staph bacteria resistant to antibiotics....some staph bacteria respond very well to antibiotics.  The same but different.", "doctor_answer": "Although everyone has 99.999% of their DNA in common, there are subtile differences.

{"question": "Why body needs vitamins?", "patient_answer": "Definition    \n\nVitamins are a group of substances essential for normal metabolism, growth and development, and regulation of cell function.\n\nVitamins work together with enzymes, co-factors (substances that assist enzymes), and other substances necessary for healthy life.\n\nFunction    \n\nEach vitamin has specific functions. If levels of a particular vitamin are inadequate, a deficiency disease results.\n\nVitamin A helps in the formation and maintenance of healthy teeth, skeletal and soft tissue, mucous membranes, and skin. It is also known as retinol because it generates the pigments that are necessary for the working of the retina. It promotes good vision, especially in dim light. Vitamin A may also be required for reproduction and breast-feeding. Beta-carotene is a precursor to vitamin A that has antioxidant properties, helping the body deal with unstable chemicals called free radicals.\n\nThiamine (B-1) helps the body cells convert carbohydrates into energy. It is also essential for the functioning of the heart and for healthy nerve cells, including those in the brain.\n\nRiboflavin (B-2) works with the other B vitamins and is important for body growth and red blood cell production. Similar to thiamine, it helps in releasing energy from carbohydrates.\n\nNiacin is a B vitamin that helps maintain healthy skin and nerves. It is also important for the conversion of food to energy and may have cholesterol-lowering effects.\n\nVitamin B-6 is also known as pyridoxine. The more protein a person eats, the more vitamin B-6 is required to help the body use the protein. It aids in the formation of red blood cells and in the maintenance of normal brain function. It also assists in the synthesizing of antibodies in the immune system.\n\nVitamin B-12, like the other B vitamins, is important for metabolism. It, too, helps in the formation of red blood cells and in the maintenance of the central nervous system.\n\nPantothenic acid is essential for the metabolism of food. It is also essential in the synthesis of hormones and cholesterol. Biotin is essential for the metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates, and in the synthesis of hormones and cholesterol. Cholesterol is needed for the functioning of cell membranes, particularly in the brain.\n\nFolate (folic acid) works with vitamin B-12 in the production of red blood cells. It is necessary for the synthesis of DNA, which controls heredity as well as tissue growth and cell function. Any woman who may become pregnant should be sure to consume enough folate -- low levels of this substance are associated with devastating birth defects such as spina bifida. Many foods are now fortified with folic acid to help reduce the level of such birth defects.\n\nVitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, promotes healthy teeth and gums, helps in the absorption of iron, and helps maintain normal connective tissue. It also promotes wound healing and is an antioxidant.\n\nVitamin D is also known as the \"sunshine vitamin,\" since it is manufactured by the body after being exposed to sunshine. Ten to 15 minutes of sunshine three times per week is adequate to produce the body's requirement of vitamin D. This vitamin promotes the body's absorption of calcium, which is essential for the normal development and maintenance of healthy teeth and bones. It also helps maintain adequate blood levels of calcium and phosphorus, which are minerals necessary for many functions.\n\nVitamin E is also known as tocopherol and is an antioxidant. It is also important in the formation of red blood cells and the use of vitamin K.\n\nVitamin K is known as the clotting vitamin, because without it blood would not coagulate. Some studies indicate that it helps in maintaining strong bones in the elderly.", "doctor_answer": "our body needs vitamins because they help our cells produce the needed energy...a vitamin deficiency is a very serious problem but gettin too much of them is pretty bad as well..."}

Growing up I was so self conscious about my smile..even though I have to wear them for about 3 years I'm constantly smiling. I’d rather people see my braces then my crooked teeth.", "doctor_answer": "Although adult orthodontics is very common, and can be extremely successful, you will want to have a complete dental and periodontal examination before beginning treatment.  Obviously, if orthodontic apliances are placed on decayed teeth, the teeth would suffer.  The same goes for trying to 'move' teeth through bone (what orthodontics does..,) when gum/bone disease is present.  \n\nIf orthodontics proceeds too quickly, or in the presence of disease, it can resorb (destroy) either tooth roots and/or supporting bone, and gum tissue. \n \nAdult orthodontics can be extremely wonderful, with predictable outcomes, but as with any irreversable medical/dental treatment, take care when choosing a provider (are they sufficiently trained?), and make sure you are compliant with your specialist's recommendations."}

{"question": "How do you get a paper cut?", "patient_answer": "Usually, when your finger quickly goes against the edge of a paper (which is thicker than a razor blade) you get a paper cut. I used to get them a lot in gradeschool since I reached into my desk, sliding my fingers alongside workbooks to identifiy which subject they were, ending up in multiple paper cuts.\nGiving yourself a paper cut is possible, run your finger very quickly along the edge of printing paper. I have stupid cousins who have tried it.", "doctor_answer": "The friction you cause when rubbing against a piece of paper has the ability to pierce through your skin because of the tiny width of the thickness it has and the amount of pressure your applying to it. Think of it in terms of a hammer and nail. A small point of pressure will drive down into something more easily with the right amount of friction and force.\n\nTrying rubbing a cardboard side to side on it's end on your skin and you will feel the heat of the friction and possibly get a cut."}

Although you get a good dose of calcium and vitamin D from milk, you can get these things from other sources, without running your system down. Milk and milk products can enhance allergies and intolerances to food and other outside stimuli, and increase mucus production. I don't know if orange juice is 'better' per se, because the vitamins it provides are completely different. I can say your body processes it easier, it gives you a bunch of vitamins, if the juice doesn't have sugary additives it isn't as fattening, and it doesn't have all the nasty side effects that milk can have, (whether you notice them or not... in fact you probably wouldn't notice them unless you cut milk out of your diet and then tried putting it back in). So I guess my vote is Orange Juice.", "doctor_answer": "milk because you can get your vitamin c somewhere else.  but orange juice does help you when u go to the bathroom.  i suggest buying orange juice with calcium in it."}

Laughter can be exhilarating, cathartic, embarrassing, debilitating, punitive, liberating, grotesque, or helpless. This course is designed to explore the universal (we believe) human phenomenon of laughter from a number of different perspectives, not all of them areas of expertise of the instructor. We will be interested in such questions as: How do we laugh? Why do we laugh? What makes us laugh? What physiological, psychological, social, and political work does or might laughter do? Do other animals laugh? Do the gods laugh? How do artists and performers make us laugh? Are there kinds of laughter? Has laughter changed across time? Across space? Is laughter gendered? Is there a specifically Roman, Japanese, or Southern laughter? Is there anything that can’t or mustn’t be funny? What is the opposite of laughter? The course will involve a series of readings and discussions—but also a series of jokes, stories, excursions, interviews, and performances. We will want not only to analyze laughter, but also to do it—and to induce it.  http://www.case.edu/sages/sem_0304.htm", "doctor_answer": "its ur body releasing stress and relaxing into a euphoric state."}

{"question": "wht is a sex?", "patient_answer": "Sex has a number of common meanings:\nSexual activities. \nSexual intercourse - or vaginal intercourse; the physical act related to sexual reproduction. \nA general topic of human or animal behavior. See human sexuality. \nSpecies gender - a biological distinction between two or more categories (sexes), such as male and female, which combine genetic material to reproduce. Some linguists object to this use of the word gender, to avoid confusion with the word's meaning in grammar. \nOther things named Sex or SEX include:\n\nSex is a 1926 play by Mae West. \nSex is a 1991 book by entertainer Madonna and photographer Steven Meisel. \nSex: The Annabel Chong Story is a 1999 documentary film about porn star Annabel Chong. \nSEX was a boutique on Kings Road in the Chelsea district of London. Owned by Malcolm McLaren, it was a seminal location in the emerging punk rock scene in the mid-1970s. \nThe \"SEX\" assembly language mnemonic is often used for the \"Sign EXtend\" machine instruction found in the PDP-11 and many other computer architectures. \nSEX is also a good mnemonic for advice about writing essays. It stands for Sentence, Explanation, and eXample. \nSex is an abbreviation for the constellation Sextans.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sex_%28disa...\n\nSex, in the scope of this article and category, refers to the male and female duality of biology and reproduction. The somewhat similar term gender has more to do with identity than biology.

Then they'll talk about your symptoms and when they began, and ask how your life in general is going, to see if there are other things that are influencing you or putting stress on you. They may review records from your doctors, and they'll ask you about your family history, to see whether there are any mental illnesses in your family.", "doctor_answer": "A psychiatric evaluation involves an interview with a mental health professional, usually some psychological testing (pencil and paper), and data from any other relavent informants (like spouse or parents).

Cyan pepper is good for your stomach lining.\n2. Cyan pepper is good for your heart\n3. Cyan pepper is good for your sinuses.\n\nProblem here is to find an actual quality brand of cyan pepper, one that isn't synthetic but herbal in nature.\n\nThe reason it is good for your stomach is that it removes toxins naturally from your stomach lining.  It also stimulates the chemicals that make the lining more firm.\n\nThe reason it is good for your heart and blood vessels is that it helps bind and remove cholesterol.  Thus enabling the system to remove the 'chunky' fat, much easier.\n\nThe reason it is good for your sinus is that it stimulates the sneeze/clear reflex.  In general it is not good to breath cyan pepper in, but eating it and just sniffing it on food is good enough to make most peoples sinuses open up.\n\nCyan pepper is also good as a compote (paste mixed with milk/water and baking soda/powder) to be used as a topical on non break skin wounds, and abbrasions.  Thus enabling the skin to retain moisture, as well as clense the area.\n\nI DO NOT reccomend using cyan pepper, with the exception for the stomach lining.

{"question": "what should be done in your community to improve access to healthcare what programs legislation or partnership", "patient_answer": "In my state there is a free to low cost state run health care program for eligible applicants. This program mandates that no pregnant woman can be denied this benefit. I know of several families who were denied this health care program including a pregnant woman, which should not have happened. As a result they and in some cases their children went without necessary medical appointments and medication. Genentech could partnership with this state government to ensure that this happens less frequently or Genentech itself could set up a program to help eligible people get the benefits they qualify for.", "doctor_answer": "To improve access to healthcare, being a small GP provider needs to be (more) profitable even in less affluent communities.

It partially cuts off the oxygen to your eye (even though many contacts nowadays let quite a bit to your eye).\n\nI have worn contacts for many years to help my vision and I love them.  However, if it's just for fun I think you should consider carefully whether you really want to put out the money.  What if you only wear them a couple of times and decide you don't like them?

{"question": "when someone's glands are swollen a lump must be present were it is swollen at?", "patient_answer": "not really.  some glands are deeper in the body, and you cannot feel them.  must keep that in mind.", "doctor_answer": "Having swollen glands (Lymph Nodes) are a typical symptom of many viral illnesses, such as colds or sore throats, that often get better with home treatment.\n\nThe lymph nodes filter lymph fluid as it flows through them, trapping bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances, which are then destroyed by special white blood cells called lymphocytes.\n\nLymph nodes may be found singly or in groups, and they may be as small as the head of a pin or as large as an olive. Groups of lymph nodes can be felt in the neck, groin, and underarms. Lymph nodes generally are not tender or painful. Most lymph nodes in the body cannot be felt."}
{"question": "how long does it take mercury from fish to leave your body?", "patient_answer": "Methylmercury is the form of mercury most easily absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract (about 95% absorbed). After you eat fish or other foods that are contaminated with methylmercury, the methylmercury enters your bloodstream easily and goes rapidly to other parts of your body.\n\nOnly small amounts of methylmercury enter the bloodstream directly through the skin, but other forms of organic mercury (in particular dimethylmercury) can rapidly enter the body through the skin. Organic mercury compounds may evaporate slowly at room temperature and may enter your body easily if you breathe in the vapors.\n\nOnce organic mercury is in the bloodstream, it moves easily to most tissues and readily enters the brain. Methylmercury that is in the blood of a pregnant woman will easily move into the blood of the developing child and then into the child's brain and other tissues.\n\nLike metallic mercury, methylmercury can be changed by your body to inorganic mercury. When this happens in the brain, the mercury can remain there for a long time.\n\nWhen methylmercury does leave your body after you have been exposed, it leaves slowly over a period of several months, mostly as inorganic mercury in the feces. As with inorganic mercury, some of the methylmercury in a nursing woman's body will pass into her breast milk. \n\nHope this helps.", "doctor_answer": "Mercury never can be metabolized and remains in tissues,very toxic even in trace amounts"}
{"question": "How do you get rid of strep throat?", "patient_answer": "Wild Mountain oregano oil taken straight.  Get the North American Herb and Spice brand or Vitality works in a bottle.

First - patience is key - there is no quick fix.  Second - wise choices are key.  You have to think of your weight loss as a lifelong committment.  It doesn't have to be a life of torture and deprivation, though.  Depending on how much structure you need, a program like Weight Watchers may be beneficial.  I tend to stay away from fruit juices because they are loaded with calories and they dump sugar in you.  Eating the whole fruit is better for you - you get the nutrients plus fiber.  Portion control is key.  But, you also shouldn't deprive yourself of everything you like.  For example, you can allow yourself a small treat (for example, a tablespoon of chocolate syrup in milk) everyday, and a larger treat once a week without sabotaging your efforts.  \n\nVery important: exercise.  If you haven't been exercising much, start small, like walking.  But keep it up and increase your activity level steadily.  A combination of weight training and aerobics really works.  You don't have to invest in a gym membership.  Go our for a walk, run, or bike ride.  Get a series of workout dvds (I recommend The Firm series)."}

Otherwise, dentists wouldn't be able to provide their services.\n\nSo, you really should get insurance.

{"question": "is it healthy to lose 20 lbs in 3 months?", "patient_answer": "Probably, but it has a lot to do with how much you weighed when you started.  If you're a woman and in need of weight loss, I'm told an average loss of 1.5 per week is good.  That's with a traditional, Weight Watchers-type reduced calorie diet, not some specialized program.  Over 3 months, 20 pounds would be about right.  But the less you weigh, the more difficult it is to lose.\n\nUsing and understanding the Body Mass Index (BMI) may help you with your goals.  It uses your height and weight to calculate how healthy your weight is.  I've included a link to Yahoo! Health's page on BMI.", "doctor_answer": "For the average person, probably not.

The severity of symptoms varies depending on the amount of lactose each individual can tolerate.\n\nIn rare cases, children are born without the ability to produce lactase.

But if you take a vitamin supplement containing either folic acid (B1) or B12, it could show an excess of B12 in a blood test.  Having a moderately elevated B12 level is not harmful, but having too little B12 can cause anemia.  Taking a folic acid (B1) supplement could prevent the blood test from detecting a B12 deficiency.  If B12 deficiency or anemia is a concern, you should consult you health practitioner about any folic acid supplements you are taking before your next blood test."}

Cars are also needed to get to and from stores to buy food and other necessities.  \n\nSmoking is not a necessity.  \n\nBut why do I dislike smoking in public?  \n\nBecause of the smokers that:\n1) Throw their cigarettes on the ground because they are too lazy to clean up after themselves.\n2) Don't pay attention when throwing them out car windows - I once had to quickly pull over on a highway to find a still-lit cigarette some rude smoker tossed out their car window and it went into mine.  And yes, non-smokers should be able to ride with the windows of their own cars down also if they want to.  Riding with them down in your own car causes no problems for other people. Carelessly tossing your cigarette does.\n3) Don't pay attention when waving them around in public, and end up hitting others with the lit end of them.\n4) Hold the cigarette away from themselves so the smoke goes into other people's faces instead of their own.\n5) Ask to be brought ashtrays when seated in the NON-smoking sectiaon of a restaurant becasue they did not want to wait for a table in the smoking section to open up.\n\nOk, I realize not ALL smokers do the above things, but those are the reasons I have a low tolerance for it.", "doctor_answer": "If people are ever permitted to park running cars in a restaurant or bar you may have a good comparison.

Hormonal differences can cause fat depostion in different places.  Women tend to put fat on around their legs and seat, while men tend to put on belly fat (after puberty).  You have probably seen men with big guts and skinny legs, but you don't ever see women who look like this.  This fat is much harder to lose than belly fat.

{"question": "wht causes ovarian cysts in the body? Any prevention?", "patient_answer": "Ovarian cysts form for numerous reasons. The most common type is a follicular cyst, which results from the growth of a follicle. A follicle is the normal fluid-filled sac that contains an egg. Follicular cysts form when the follicle grows larger than normal during the menstrual cycle and does not open to release the egg. Usually, follicular cysts resolve on their own over the course of days to months. Cysts can contain blood (hemorrhagic or endometrioid cysts) from injury or leakage of tiny blood vessels into the egg sac. If a woman is in her 40's, or younger, and has regular menstrual periods, most ovarian masses are \"functioning ovarian cysts,\" which are not really abnormal. They are related to the process of ovulation that happens with the menstrual cycle. They usually disappear on their own during a future menstrual cycle. Therefore, especially in women in their 20's and 30's, these cysts are watched for a few menstrual cycles to verify that they disappear. Because oral contraceptives work in part by preventing ovulation, physicians will not really expect women who are taking oral contraceptives to have common \"functioning ovarian cysts.\" Thus, women who develop ovarian cysts while taking oral contraceptives may be advised against simple observation; rather, they may receive closer monitoring with pelvic ultrasound or, less commonly, surgical exploration of the ovary. Functional ovarian cysts cannot be prevented if you are ovulating. Anything that makes ovulation less frequent reduces your chance of developing an ovarian cyst. Birth control pills, pregnancy, and breast-feeding in the first 6 months following birth prevent ovulation. Ovulation ceases when menopause is complete. Women who use high-dose birth control pills have a modestly decreased risk of developing functional ovarian cysts; low-dose birth control pills seem to have a less preventive effect.", "doctor_answer": "It depends on how big the cyst is and depends on the doctors.  If you have one, it normally is not a big deal.  Many females deal with PCOS which is poly-cystic ovary syndrome.  Which means when a female has this they have many different cysts that cover the ovaries. And this females live perfectly normal lives for the most part.  Just go talk to an OB-GYN."}

{"question": "How does heredity play a role in schizo affective disorder or can it be inherited?", "patient_answer": "The word \"schizo-affective disorder\" is simply a label used to categorise a list of psychosocial traits that Psychiatry considers to be improper or abnormal in society. Psychiatry defines these traits as a \"mental illness\", and promotes it as a \"disease\" that requires \"treatment\".\n\nIt is not a \"disease\", despite claims made in certain peoples answers here. There is NO credible scientific evidence that shows the existence of what constitutes \"schizo-affecive disorder\", \"schizophrenia\" or ANY mental illness, as a genetic, biological/neurological disorder, brain abnormality or \"chemical imbalance\".\n\n\"For a disease to exist there must be a tangible, objective physical abnormality that can be determined by a test such as, but not limited to, blood or urine test, X-Ray, brain scan or biopsy. All reputable doctors would agree: No physical abnormality, no disease. In psychiatry, no test or brain scan exists to prove that a 'mental disorder' is a physical disease. Disingenuous comparisons between physical and mental illness and medicine are simply part of psychiatry's orchestrated but fraudulent public relations and marketing campaign.\" Fred A. Baughman Jr., MD (Neurologist, Pediatric Neurology), & Fellow at the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n\"Chemical imbalance…it’s a shorthand term really, it’s probably drug industry derived… We don’t have tests because to do it, you’d probably have to take a chunk of brain out of someone - not a good idea.\" Dr. Mark Graff, Chair of the Committee of Public Affairs for the American Psychiatric Association. July, 2005.\n\nSymptoms that psychiatry labels as \"schizo-affective disorder\" (or it's related disorders), can stem from any number of variable sources. Many people have overcome disorders such as \"bipolar\" and \"schizo affective disorder\" through effective megavitamin therapy and effective nutrition. A growing wealth of evidence supports that underlying nutritional deficiencies can cause even the most severe mental disorders, including \"schizophrenia\". [1,2,3,4,5,6] \n\nYou may also be interested to know that the work undertaken by pioneers such as Dr. Lars Martensson and the late Dr. Loren Mosher show that there is also another way - far safer and more effective than psychiatric restraint, drugs and electro-shocks. For over a decade Loren R Mosher, MD, held a central position in American psychiatric research. He was the first Chief of the Center for Studies of Schizophrenia at the National Institute of Mental Health, 1969-1980. He founded the Schizophrenia Bulletin and for ten years he was its Editor-in-Chief. He also led the Soteria Project, which demonstrated that effective rehabilitation is possible without harmful antipsychotic drugs. Soteria provided a safe and sane environment where schizophrenic patients could stay, medication-free, with a young, nonprofessional staff trained to listen to and understand them and provide companionship. The idea was that schizophrenia or related disorders can often be overcome with the help of meaningful relationships, rather than with drugs, and that such treatment would eventually lead to unquestionably healthier lives. The results were fantastic. Over just 6 weeks, patients recovered as quickly as those treated with medication in hospitals. [7,8] \n\nBottom line? Psychiatry is a belief-system, a \"faith\", not a science. Despite the huge marketing strategies, the so-called \"research\" and all the propaganda thrown at the world, there is not one iota of scientific evidence that proves that \"schizophrenia\" or ANY mental illness, in fact, exists as an actual --medical disease--.\n\nIf you have been told differently then know this: You have been lied to.\n\nFor more information, please visit:\n\nhttp://groups.msn.com/psychbusters\nDecoding Psychiatric Propaganda", "doctor_answer": "http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?Section=By_Illness&template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=11837\n\ni hope this helps, its a very reputable sight."}
{"question": "What's a \"compounding pharmacy\"?", "patient_answer": "They actually mix liquids, powders and other drugs to create a specific compound for the patient.  Noncompounding pharmacies just dispense pills and potions, and do no mixing.  It's quite common for nursing homes to have a compounding pharm.", "doctor_answer": "a \"compounding pharmacy\" is a pharmacy that will take one type of medication and put it with another medicine or another type of vehicle in which to give the medicine.  For instance, say that you had a cat that wouldn't take it's medicine - I would call up this compounding pharmacy and ask them to grind up the pills and put it into a specially flavored medicine (triple fish works well).  Or - they could put it into a gel that we could put on the cat's ear - and it would go through the skin.  Or you could mix two medicines together, etc.  They also sell medicines like a regualar pharmacies.  Hoope that helps!"}

These include headaches, morning stiffness, difficulty concentrating, a circulatory problem that affects the small blood vessels of the skin (Raynaud's phenomenon), and irritable bowel syndrome. As with many conditions that cause chronic pain, anxiety and depression are common in people with fibromyalgia and may make symptoms worse.\n\nSymptoms tend to come and go. Periods when they are constant (flares) may be followed by periods when they are absent (remissions). Some people find that cold, damp weather, emotional stress, overexertion, and other factors make their symptoms worse", "doctor_answer": "Pain and stiffness will be arising in muscles or in other soft tissues.

{"question": "is creatine safe?", "patient_answer": "In a nutshell... \n\nYes.  But here's more information.\n\nWhat is Creatine?\n\nCreatine is a nutrient naturally found in all our bodies. It is a combination of 3 amino acids; arginine, glycine and methionine. Creatine helps provide the energy our muscles need to move, particularly quick and explosive movements. Muscle contraction is initially fuelled by ATP (adenosine-triphosphate ).\n\nIs Creatine Safe?\n\nYes, Creatine is a natural amino acid present in the body of humans and animals. The human body has 100-115 grams of creatine in the form of creatine phosphate. No negative side effects have been noted in the research with the recommended levels of supplementation.\n\nAre there any noted side effects?\n\nCreatine is so efficient at shuttling water into the intramuscular compartment, that an emergent side effect associated with it is that of muscle cramping. This most often occurs when too little fluid is consumed whilst supplementing with creatine. Muscle Cramping, strains and tears are all anecdotal evidence that are not supported by scientific fact.\n\nThis supplement has over 100 peer reviewed published studies.  It's well researched and the safety in the short term and long term is well known.\n\nPersonally I wouldn't recommend this supplement to teenagers but that is my own opinion, not based on facts supporting any side effects in teenage use.", "doctor_answer": "I have never read any negative side effects of creatine beyond headaches and loose stool.  Most reports I have read state that it's actually beneficial for your body, possibly even in the long run.  If you do take it, I would take it in moderation, and I would stay away from anything that isn't pure creatine monohydrate.  I would certainly encourage you to do real research before starting it.  It is your body you're dealing with."}

{"question": "How long until I can return to running after dislocating my ankle?", "patient_answer": "Best to ask your doctor, as individuals vary greatly in terms of healing time. But as a fellow runner, I will say this -- returning to running too quickly and intensely really increases the risk of you getting seriously injured the next time and putting you on the bench for a long time.\n\nIt's best to wait until your ankle feels completely well, no pain or weirdness when you walk around. Then, ease back into the running -- 15 minutes of running; 15 minutes of walking. Gradually build back up to where you were before. You may resent losing the time initially, but take it from me -- it's better than gaining the time now but losing WAY more on your second injury!", "doctor_answer": "I`m doing sports and I`ve dislocated my ankle few times.

{"question": "How can I treat strepp throat naturally?", "patient_answer": "You should really see your doctor first, not only to make sure what you have is strep, but also to see if you might need antibiotics. \nThere are many ways that you can make yourself feel better while you are waiting for the strep infection to go away.\n\nDrink plenty of fluids and increase humidity (moisture in the air) in your home to help keep your throat moist. Herbal teas formulated for colds may help relieve symptoms. \nTake nonprescription medications to relieve a painful sore throat and reduce fever. \nGet plenty of rest. Stay home the first day of antibiotic treatment. You are still contagious and might pass the infection to others. Rest in bed if you feel very sick. Bed rest is not required if you feel fine. \nFor the first 24 to 48 hours after you start taking an antibiotic, you are still contagious. You can avoid passing the strep throat infection to others and reinfecting yourself by:\n\nAvoiding sneezing or coughing on others. \nWashing your hands often. \nUsing tissues you can throw away, not handkerchiefs. \nThrowing out your toothbrush as soon as you feel sick. Replace it again when you are well. You can also clean your toothbrush well before using it again. Bacteria can collect on the bristles and reinfect you.", "doctor_answer": "You should see a doctor to make sure it is actually strep throat.  Once it is officially diagnosed you need to take special precautions because an untreated strep infection can cause heart problems later in life.  Be careful using natural treatments for this problem (I am a natural health care provider so I am all for natural health treatments and believe antibiotics should be used as a last resort)"}

{"question": "How to lose weight after giving birth?", "patient_answer": "I had a baby three months ago and had almost no problem getting back down to my normal size because I exercised right up until the day I gave birth.  \n\nIf you didn't stay in shape before giving birth, it might be a little harder.  You must ease yourself into a workout again.  Check with your doctor first then once you get the OK, target your problem areas.  Don't expect walking or other cardio exercise to be your only answer to getting back in shape.  Some form of resistance training is a must whether it is moderate weight lifting, or body sculpting using weights, bands and/or balls, etc.  Resistance training will actually build up your muscle and help you burn fat faster and raise your metabolism.  Pilates is another great, low impact way to get your abs and waistline back in shape.\n   \nAlso, are you breastfeeding?  That is one of the best ways to get your belly down after giving birth.  Plus, it uses up calories.  However, if you overcompensate for your lost calories by eating too much, you will gain weight.  \n    \nAs far as your diet is concerned, try to eat 5 or 6 small, healthy meals a day because this will keep your metabolism going.  Also, try to choose healthy options that are high in whole grains and protein and low in sugar and fat.  You can indulge in some not-so-healthy things but watch your portions.\n\n    I know that it is so hard to find the time and energy to work out once you have a new baby.  Just make sure to find at least 10 minutes here and there to work out.  If you can manage to do that 3 times a day, then you're off to a great start and can build up from there.", "doctor_answer": "After my wife's experience I can safely advice you to be carefull of how much chocolate you consume and (This is a must) go for a walk or in a gym on daily basis"}

Then go clockwise around the edge of your vision, twice slowly, then three times quickly.  Then the same thing but counterclockwise.  Finish off by holding up your thumb in front of you, and switching back and forth a few times between focusing on your thumb and focusing on a more distant object (such as the wall).

{"question": "How do you treat Fungus Toenails?", "patient_answer": "Treatment for a fungal nail infection includes using medications, taking steps to prevent the infection from returning, and possibly removing the affected nail. Treatment is generally successful; however, treatment does not work for 20% to 25% of people with the condition.  Standard treatment for fungal nail infection includes one or a combination of the following:\nAntifungal pills (oral medication) offer the best chance of a cure. However, they require close monitoring for dangerous side effects and are generally reserved for moderate-to-severe or difficult-to-treat fungal nail infections. Pills include terbinafine (Lamisil), itraconazole (Sporanox), and fluconazole (Diflucan). \nAntifungal topical medication (creams, lotions, gels, and lacquers) are applied to the infected nail and surrounding areas of the skin. However, they are not very effective. They are sometimes used for mild-to-moderate infections and may be used to help prevent an infection from returning or to prevent athlete's foot from spreading to the nails. Topical medications include terbinafine (Lamisil) and ciclopirox (Penlac). \nRemoval of an infected nail is used for severe or recurring fungal nail infections. Combining nail removal with antifungal creams or pills is likely to be more effective than using one of these treatments alone. Nail removal is rarely necessary. \nIn nonsurgical nail removal, a urea ointment is put on the nail, softening and dissolving it for easy removal. \nIn surgical nail removal, the infected nail and tissue is fully removed (avulsion) or partially removed (debridement).", "doctor_answer": "You should be greatful for snugglebunny' also get pedicures every 2 weeks, have the , tech, grind the nail surface down, (dosnt hurt), this alows creams to absorb the nail face, as bunny says ,Meds can cause liver damage, also wash your feet with the coldest water !

It is the combination of self-awareness and control of martial arts, the focus and strength of boxing, and the grace and rhythm of dance. \n\n• The word \"Tae\" means \"foot and leg\" in the Korean language, due to the movements that emphasize    the lower body. \n• \"Bo\" is a shortened version of the word \"box.\" \n• However, all the letters of \"Tae Bo®\" have an important meaning as well, because they are significant    to the essential demands of \"Tae Bo®\". \n\nIt is important to remember that Tae Bo® will give back to you what it asks of you. It is like the laws of the universe, if you plant a seed and nourish it, it is guaranteed to grow. As your will is tested it is also strengthened. While you push your body you build it as well.

{"question": "What are the chance of a mistake on a pap-smear test?", "patient_answer": "What are false positive and false negative results? \nThe Pap test is a screening test and, like any such test, it is not 100-percent accurate. Although false positive and false negative results do not occur very often, they can cause anxiety and can affect a woman’s health.\n\nA false positive Pap test means that a patient is told she has abnormal cells, but the cells are actually normal. A false negative Pap test occurs when a specimen is called normal, but the woman has a significant abnormality that was missed. A false negative Pap test may delay the diagnosis and treatment of a precancerous condition. However, regular screening helps to compensate for the false negative result. If abnormal cells are missed at one time, chances are good that the cells will be detected the next time.\n\nWhat methods are being developed to improve the accuracy of Pap tests? \nIn April 1996, the Consensus Development Conference on Cervical Cancer, which was convened by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), concluded that about half of false negative Pap tests are due to inadequate specimen collection. The other half are due to a failure to identify or interpret the specimens correctly. Although the conventional Pap test is effective in the majority of cases, the conference made it clear that new methods of collecting and reading specimens are needed to reduce the number of false negatives.\n\nThe Bethesda System requires laboratories to determine whether there are enough cervical cells in the specimen to make a proper evaluation. This requirement helps improve the quality of samples and sample collection. The Bethesda System requires a sample to be categorized as “satisfactory for evaluation” or “unsatisfactory for evaluation.”\n\nOne new method of collecting and analyzing samples is called liquid-based thin-layer slide preparation. This method may make it easier to screen for abnormal cells. Cervical cells are collected with a brush or other collection instrument. The instrument is rinsed in a vial of liquid preservative. The vial is sent to a laboratory, where an automated thin-layer slide device prepares the slide for viewing. Results of this method suggest that it is comparable to, or more sensitive than, standard Pap tests for the detection of significant abnormalities.\n\nComputer automated readers are also being used to improve the reading of Pap tests. This technology uses a microscope that conveys a cellular image to a computer, which analyzes the image for the presence of abnormal cells.", "doctor_answer": "I would think as with any tests done it could happen. If you believe it has happened to you go have another one done. (I know no one likes them)"}

{"question": "WHAT IS A SICKLE CELL DISEASE?", "patient_answer": "Sickle Cell Anemia is a common autosomal recessive disorder resulting from the production of a variant hemoglobin called HbS (sickle cell hemoglobin).\n\nIt is typically caused by a point mutation in the beta-globin gene at residue 6, Glu →Val (GAG→ GTG) causing a loss of a negative charge and a decreased solubility of the mutant Hb (HbS).  Under low oxygen tension, HbS aggregate (polymerizes in rod shaped form), distorting the  shape of the RBC to sickle shape.  This misshapen RBC is unable to squeeze through capillaries causing vascular occlusion and consequently local hypoxia or hemolysis.\n\nBecause sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive condition, in order for a child to get it, they can inherit it from either one or both of their parents, and in the former case, they will be a carrier and will exhibit sickle cell trait (e.g., only some blood cells are sickled).  In the latter case, all their RBCs will be sickled.  In places such as Africa where Malaria (plasmodium falciparum) is quite prevalent, sickle cell trait provides a selective advantage for carriers.\n\nSome common symptoms are:\nAnemia (Hb level 6-10 g/dL)\nFailure to thrive\nSplenomegaly\nRepeated infection\nPainful swelling of hands or feet (from occlusion of capillaries) \nInfection major cause of death", "doctor_answer": "Sickle cell anemia is an inability of red blood cells to properly carry oxygen due to a change in the genetic code.  It is notable because the affected cells fold over to form thin, curved RBCs resembling sickles (the farm tools).  Also notable is that the disease is genetic and caused by a single change in the DNA.  It is far more prevalent in African-Americans.  Symptoms are similar to any anemia: general malaise (lack of energy)."}

{"question": "what is stress?", "patient_answer": "an unpleasant state of emotional and physiological arousal that people experience in situations that they perceive as dangerous or threatening to their well-being. The word stress means different things to different people. Some people define stress as events or situations that cause them to feel tension, pressure, or negative emotions such as anxiety and anger. Others view stress as the response to these situations. This response includes physiological changes—such as increased heart rate and muscle tension—as well as emotional and behavioral changes. However, most psychologists regard stress as a process involving a person’s interpretation and response to a threatening event.\n\nStress is a common experience. We may feel stress when we are very busy, have important deadlines to meet, or have too little time to finish all of our tasks. Often people experience stress because of problems at work or in social relationships, such as a poor evaluation by a supervisor or an argument with a friend. Some people may be particularly vulnerable to stress in situations involving the threat of failure or personal humiliation. Others have extreme fears of objects or things associated with physical threats—such as snakes, illness, storms, or flying in an airplane—and become stressed when they encounter or think about these perceived threats. Major life events, such as the death of a loved one, can cause severe stress.\nStress can have both positive and negative effects. Stress is a normal, adaptive reaction to threat. It signals danger and prepares us to take defensive action. Fear of things that pose realistic threats motivates us to deal with them or avoid them. Stress also motivates us to achieve and fuels creativity. Although stress may hinder performance on difficult tasks, moderate stress seems to improve motivation and performance on less complex tasks. In personal relationships, stress often leads to less cooperation and more aggression. \n\nIf not managed appropriately, stress can lead to serious problems. Exposure to chronic stress can contribute to both physical illnesses, such as heart disease, and mental illnesses, such as anxiety disorders. The field of health psychology focuses in part on how stress affects bodily functioning and on how people can use stress management techniques to prevent or minimize disease.", "doctor_answer": "Stress is your body's early warning system.

It makes you crave carbs. The best bet is to make a diet plan for a whole day with a maximum number of calories you need to maintain your current weight and don't exceed that number. There are lots of calculators on the web that will tell you how many calories that is. Choose a lot of vegtables, whole grain, and fruit since they are low in calories and have lots of fiber which takes longer to digest which will slow down you hunger. It is possible to stuff you face with as much food as you can eat and do it in a healthy way. After a year of me doing this I lost 50lbs. and no longer crave the old junk I used to eat.

{"question": "what is scarlett fever?", "patient_answer": "Did you mean Scarlet fever??\n\nScarlet fever is a rash accompanied by a sore throat caused by the streptococcus bacteria.\n\nThe disease most commonly affects children, but can occur in any age group. The characteristic symptoms are a rash and a 'strawberry tongue'. The disease is treated with antibiotics and it is usually resolved without complications.\n\nA person can become infected with streptococcus either by touching or through airborne droplets. Scarlet fever appears together with a streptococcal sore throat. The incubation period - the time that passes from infection until the outbreak of the disease - is two to four days.\n\nsymptoms\nA sore throat. \n\n\nA temperature. \n\n\nHeadache. \n\n\nFeeling generally unwell. \n\n\nA rash that develops within 12 hours of the onset and rapidly becomes generalised. \n\n\nThe face is spared, but cheeks are flushed, and the child looks 'scarlet' except for the area around the mouth. \n\n\nThe rash fades after a few days, or sooner if treatment with antibiotics is given, following which the skin undergoes peeling. \n\n\nThe tongue has a thick, white coating that peels after four or five days, producing a red strawberry appearance. \n\n\nGood advice \n\n\nWhen the symptoms appear consult a GP. \n\n\nPain on swallowing may be eased by hot drinks and soft food. \n\n\nGive the patient plenty of fluids.", "doctor_answer": "Scarlet fever/Scarlatina\nScarlet fever is a streptococcal infection that occurs most often in association with a sore throat and rarely with impetigo or other streptococcal infections. It is characterized by sore throat, fever and a rash over the upper body that may spread to cover almost the entire body.\nSigns and Symptoms: Persons with scarlet fever have a characteristic rash that is fine, red, rough-textured and blanches upon pressure. Scarlet fever also produces a bright red tongue with \"strawberry\" appearance. The skin often \"desquamates,\" or peels, after recovery, usually on tips of fingers and toes.\n\nTransmission\nThe illness is spread by the same means as strep throat.\nTreatment\nOther than the occurrence of the rash, the treatment and course of scarlet fever are no different from those of any strep throat.\nChange in virulence\nRead any novel of the 18th century and Scarlet Fever often seems to be followed by many months in convalescence institutions. Most children now are ill for under a week. Whilst this is used as an example of the benefits of antibiotics, it is also true that the bacteria mutated in the early-mid 20th century into less virulent forms. The term Scarlatina is used to describe the modern milder disease."}
{"question": "I have Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrom what is the best diet or excercises I should do to loose weight?", "patient_answer": "i agree with the above, you need a good support system.  Make sure to not eat a lot of foods with sugar and carbs as PCOS can cause hypoglycemia and diabetes.  You also need to be doing light cardio exercises a few times a week.

{"question": "why is it i breathe through my nose only when sleeping?", "patient_answer": "Well, breathing only through your nose is the typical way of breathing, so I'm not sure what about breathing only through your nose is a problem for you.\n\nBreathing being involutary, most people do not pay attention to how they breathe. Paying attention to how you breathe probably does have the effect of making you more anxious and it would seem to keep you from going to sleep as quickly as you would if you weren't always monitoring your breathing. Monitoring your breathing keeps you alert rather than helping you relax and fall asleep.\n\nMy notion: you are too focused on how you breath. As long as you don't have mechanical difficulties breathing then it doesn't matter how you breathe. Work on not paying attention to this....", "doctor_answer": "When you breathe through only nose, more heat accumulates in your body. Breatheing through mouth dissapates heat.\n\nAnd there are more benefits of doing so. Its considered bad to breathe through mouth for some reasons.\n\nhttp://www.breathing.com/articles/nose-breathing.htm\n\nSo there is nothing to worry about for your problem. You are perfectly alright.\n\nOne more thing is that, even though we all are alike, but our overall ability of matabolism is a balance of this breathing and our other muscular factors and ofcourse number of times our hearts beat. For example, the Neanderthals used to have bigger and more open nose, so as to breathe rapidly and conserve heat. So you are what you are made of and don't try to fight it, unless its uncomfortable for you."}
{"question": "I wake up with shooting pain in my right heel, daily, how do I fix it?", "patient_answer": "I had this for a long time in my left heel and did not know what this \"knife\" in my foot was...until I found out that I had a ruptured disc (L4/L5 area)and the ruptured disc was pushing against the sciatic nerve that was going through the left leg...in your case the ruptured disc is pushing out on the right side and affects your right leg. You COULD stay in bed - flat - for 3 days and see if it gets better...the \"red hot inflamed\" nerve may calm down a bit and you might feel better...you could take Aleve to calm the inflamation of the nerve...you could get a shot of Cordisone in the spine...anywhichway...you need to see a neurologist who will take an MRI and tell you if you need surgery. In my case I am overweight and they did not want to touch me \"with a ten foor pole\". I healed mine by going the other way...I found a machine called VAX-D at a chiropractors and (look on google) was able to go 30 times and then I was completely out of pain and able to walk again. \nOther things you will feel with this is numbness in your right thigh...occasionally a nerve-line pain all the way down your right leg and also a \"spray\" of pain over the top of your right foot. You SHOULD have also a \"pilot-lite\" burning feeling in your lower back on the right side of the spine where the actual disc is pushing. This is the line of the nerves...from the lower back through the right side of the leg into the foot. Go look at a picture of the nerves that go through the body. \nBonati Institute in Florida will also do Laser surgery for this...but in my case it did not work.\nGood luck!\nThe Oracle", "doctor_answer": "hello!Maybe you should go to a chiropractic.You see,I am studying Alternative Medecine and this works out perfectly."}

{"question": "What exactly  is muscle tone?", "patient_answer": "\"Muscle tone is the continuous and passive partial contraction of the muscles. It helps maintain posture and is often present during REM sleep.\n\nUnconscious nerve impulses maintain the muscles in a partially contracted state. If a sudden pull or stretch occurs, the body responds by automatically increasing the muscle's tension, a reflex which helps guard against danger as well as helping to maintain balance.\n\nSome people use the term muscle tone to refer to how \"in shape\" a person is. Technically, what they are referring to is muscular strength or a low fat-to-muscle ratio. \"Toned\" in that context means \"fit\" or \"trim.\"\n\nPhysical disorders can result in abnormally low (hypotonia) or high (hypertonia) muscle tone.\"\n\nAn example of this is with my son.  He has Cerebral Palsy and has hypertonia.  This makes many tasks very difficult for him.", "doctor_answer": "slight tension in a relaxed muscle which keeps the muscles from sagging and gives the flesh its proper firmness"}
{"question": "why Pain After Root Canal?", "patient_answer": "A root canal is usually the drilling out (removal) of the tooth nerve because of decay, or an abscess. If the infection itself has not caused pain, then often the drilling deep inside the nerve channel will. This will subside after the infection is removed, or after the effects of the drilling wear away. In a few days, you will feel better. Infections may require use of an antibiotic for a few days after the doctor finishes. As the nurse indicated, Tylenol (or its equivalent) is helpful until the tooth heals.", "doctor_answer": "Any type of medical/dental procedure will be followed with pain.  Natural tissue inflammation may cause discomfort for a few days, which can be controlled by an over-the-counter analgesic."}

They suggest vitimans or citric acids.  \n\nI know that eating a large carb meal (like spaghetti) can make you tired.

{"question": "What is the best treatment for canker sores?", "patient_answer": "Canker sores usually go away without any treatment. For pain relief, you can try taking ibuprofen (brand name: Advil) or acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol).

You put these medicines right on the sore.\n\nYou can also mix equal amounts of Milk of Magnesia and Benadryl Allergy liquid. After it's mixed, you can swish a teaspoonful in your mouth for about 1 minute and then spit it out. If you do this every 4 to 6 hours, your canker sores may hurt less.\n\nSome people think that sucking on zinc lozenges, taking vitamin C or vitamin B complex, using a sage-and-chamomile mouthwash or taking a lysine supplement helps their canker sores heal faster.", "doctor_answer": "You could try taking the HErpes medicin (I have forgotten the name) but it has worked, when I went thru a period of time where i had canker sores weekly.\n\nGood Luck"}

{"question": "what is the best anti-depressant?", "patient_answer": "There is no best, since everybodys brain reacts differently to chemicals one may work great for you and another may work great for your friend.  Doctors prescribe these medications based on what drug reps have hooked them up, so most likely you will go home with a sample of something the first time and if that doesn't work then you become the test rat.  As a counselor a few that I have seen have the least side effects are Lexapro, Zoloft, Paxil and WelButrin.  I would highly recommend counseling or therapy before starting any of the brain drugs, most want the quick fix, which comes with medication but you will find that 6 months down the road the medication will quit working, so it will be increased, changed, or you will be told you have other problems for which a new medication is added, next thing you know you are taking all these drugs and feeling worse.  So I wouldn't take any of them, but if you feel you must do some research on whatever it is your prescribed, so at least you know what long term side effects there are, but in most cases there will be no evidence of what these are because the drugs are so new.  Just take a trip down to a local mental health agency and take a look at some of the people were put on the wonderfull antidepressants and other brain drugs that were so miraculous for there time that now the people who took them don't have a clue where they are.

{"question": "why is chalazion cyst growing?", "patient_answer": "First look at the reason why they occur:\n\nLipid breakdown products, possibly from bacterial enzymes (as free fatty acids), from retained sebaceous secretions leak into the surrounding tissue and incite a granulomatous inflammatory response. The resulting mass of granulation tissue and chronic inflammation (with lymphocytes and lipid-laden macrophages) distinguishes a chalazion from an internal or external hordeolum, which is primarily an acute pyogenic inflammation with polymorphonuclear leucocytes and necrosis with pustule formation. However, one condition can result in the other because of their close proximity. On clinical examination, the single nontender, firm nodule (or in rare cases, multiple nodules) is located deep within the lid or the tarsal plate, whereas a hordeolum is more superficial.\n\nNow, if its is growing, then you probably are having  this reaction occuring still.", "doctor_answer": "You've got the best answer you are likely to get after three months.

If you have received an answer that meets your needs, please choose a 'best answer.'\nRegards.", "doctor_answer": "There are two possible causes that I am aware of. \n\nOne is that your eyes simply are too dry, and are making excess tears to compensate. After the eyes have watered in excess for an extended period of time, the oil film on the eye becomes depleted, making the eyes even more irritated and leading to even more watering. There are really good artificial tears on the market to help this, or your doctor can prescribe something that will help your body to correct the problem by making more of its own \"proper\" tears.\n\nAlso, there is the possibility that the lining of your eyelid has become irritated, and the eye is making excess tears to help ease the irritation. \n\nA visit to your opthomologist sounds in order.  Good luck!"}
{"question": "My daughter is 6months and she is breastfeed why is one breast larger my milk is flowing the right way?", "patient_answer": "It's not a problem that one breast is larger.  Does she stay on the smaller breast?  If so, then she is likely getting milk on that side as well.  Sometimes, one breast will enlarge more when filled.  Also, as your daughter gets older, you will notice less engorment overall.  Perhaps your smaller breast has already started this and the larger one will follow.  As long as your daughter seems content after feeding and is gaining weight appropriatly, you've got nothing to worry about.", "doctor_answer": "The above answer sounds right, just be sure to not start her on the same breast every time.

Pool is good, or bike also floor mat excercise like weights and sit ups. You can burn fat and keep off your foot as long as you raise your heart rate."}
{"question": "What is the cure of seborrheic dermatitis?", "patient_answer": "Unfortunately there is no cure, I have seborrheic dermatitis myself.

{"question": "An Asprin a day really good for you?", "patient_answer": "I wouldn't take it without talking to your doctor first.\n\nSmall (81mg) doses of aspirin have some positive affects on heart disease patients.  It has also been used as preventative therapy.  But again, I'd check with the doc first.", "doctor_answer": "No.  I am a strong believer in not taking medicine unless it all to critical.  Think about all the times watching or reading the news doctors show in a new study that eating a pound of salt a day is good; then next year they say its bad.  This happens all the time with modern medicine.  So my suggestion is only take the medicine if you truly need it."}
{"question": "HOW  CAN YOU TELL WHEN YOUR LEGS HAVE DIEBETIES?", "patient_answer": "I believe you are asking specifically how a person's legs look/feel when diabetes is present in their system.  If so, the legs tend to swell and you cannot stand on them for long periods of time.  They ache constantly.  Only a doctor can diagnose this illness for sure and will suggest treatment.  Diabetes is also usually inherited. But you can also have the \"old age\" as they call it, diabetes, which my father had in his 60s.  That was caused by too much alcohol and too much rich food (and not exercising and in general, just taking care of yourself.)  So because it was \"old age\" and the diabetes was brought on by outside 'triggers' (i.e., food and alcohol), it is not in our family.  But please get your legs checked out.", "doctor_answer": "When the rest of you has diabetes."}
{"question": "what is the best way to lose weight?", "patient_answer": "WHAT to eat for losing weight\n\n• Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially NC (negative calorie) food.\n\n* Print these lists. They will be your ... \"Bible\", from now on !\n* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\n• Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\n• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\n• Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have \"low fat\" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\n• About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\n if u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound.  i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs", "doctor_answer": "It is hard to answer that objectively as differing methods have worked well for different populations.  You have to find what works best for you.  Obviously a good diet and exercise is the healthiest way, but there's a lot too it.  So you need to get educated on physical activity and dietary methods that work best for you.\n\nTry and stay away from quick fixes and promises to lose large amounts of weight quickly as this will likely jeopordize your long-term health (and short-term finances)\n\nSeek the advice of a trained fitness specialist and your local health club for more information."}

{"question": "Does Anyone know enough about Fibromyalgia to suggest alternative treatments that could help?", "patient_answer": "I have had Fibro since I was 16 and am now almost 36. I have the same diagnosises as you including Myofascial Pain Syndrome and others. Actually, MPS should be a given. In my experience pain medications do not work. I have also tried biofeedback, steroid shots, trigger point injections, nerve blocks, accupuncture, foot braces, wrist braces, carpal tunnel release surguries, and so much more. All just torture and I felt like a guinea pig.\nMy best advise is make sure to get plenty of sleep, take a multiple vitamin, keep active in at least low impact sports, and consider Magnesium and Malic Acid supplements (consult the doctor or a nutritionist to have your Magnesuim level checked- it is a simpe mouth swab and not painful), meditation does help some in keeping the pain back if you can seperate your mind from the pain, and try to take 2-3 warm Epson Salt baths a week (Epson salt contains Magnesium and soaking in a warm tub of it helps to get the mineral into the body. Magnesium aids the muscles in using oxygen and when the level is low which is typical in Fibro it can cause are cramps, spasms, and pain.) \nAlso, Fibromyalgia is a neurotransmitter disorder certain foods can trigger similiar symptoms to Fibro. Try eliminating Monsodium Glutamate from your diet. I did and some of my symptoms (chronic headaches and nausea) went away. It is in everything from Doritos to chicken soup. A few key finding's of an FDA study found MSG to cause a \"burning sensation in the back of the neck, forearms and chest\". Otherwise, learn your limits and pace yourself.\nGood luck!", "doctor_answer": "Grape seed extract is the best I know of for any auto immune disorder including Fibromyalgia, lupus, chrons, and any other type of inflamation.

{"question": "can Diabetes be controlled without medicine. If yes how?", "patient_answer": "Only with adult onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. If you got it when you were a kid, forget about it, you'll need medicine for the rest of your life. \nBut if you developed it at an older age, it is most likey type 2, and can be controlled with strict diet and exercise. Not definite, but it is always worth a try. Here is a good diet I would suggest:\n\n\nFirst of all, (very important) don't eat ANY type of meat . This includes any soups that have a beef/chicken stock as the base. So buy vegetarian vegetable soup...not just vegetable soup, and eat it for supper(Campbell's (don't buy generic brand..its bland). This also includes milk. No cow milk. Buy some Soy milk. I promise it is delicious..I use 8th continent original soymilk. And this is 100% healthier than cow milk. This will help you alot. \n(no butter for a week!!, no ranch dressing, no sour cream...nothing of the sort...and try to lay off of the cheese unless it is soy cheese) \n\nSecond of all, no candy bars, chocolates, donuts with frosting center, cakes, ice cream....just go 1 week without sweets  \nI usually eat oatmeal for breakfast, and I either cut up fresh peaches, strawberries or even canned peaches and I don't need any sugar. \nFor a good snack in between I drink a mug of hot lemon water with honey added to sweeten. \n(*when feeling hungry, drinking a mug/cup of anything warm will ease your hungry tummy*) \nFor snacks when craving sweets: eat almonds, peanuts, soynuts, raisins, ovaltine mixed with soymilk is ok on this detox diet, drink a big cup of orange juice, eat fresh fruit, apples, oranges, strawberries, etc. \nEat vegetables and rice. Can buy frozen packages of broccolli, cauliflower, carrots, and raw type as well for snacks. \nGot a blender? Make smoothies with your new fruit selections, a natural, detoxing milkshake. Just don't use yogurt(which is cow milk based), >>>but add some soymilk, orange juice, bananas and strawberries for a shake that is out of this world!!!! \nI have always used this as my way to start exercising again. \n\n(tip: Slim Fast products have always helped me too(even though the shakes are cow-milk based). They have a meal bar called \"fruit & nut bar\" that is great. If i wake up and want to go for a jog or exercise, I take about 2-3 bites (don't eat whole bar before exercising) and it helps me feel not-sluggish during my workout.) \n\nMajor tip: anyone over the age of 20 should be taking a daily vitamin. I HIGHLY suggest buying some multivitamins (i use a woman's weight smart MV), Super B-Complex, and Vitamin C. These 3 are a must-take-each-day and you'll see an even better change in a couple of weeks. If I am feeling bloated, I buy diurex water pills and take for 5-7 days as well.\n\nFollow this strictly and you WILL see a change & feel better, that is a promise!\n\n(warning: if you have any cardiovascular problems at all do Not use water pills unless it is ok'd by your doctor, as it will interfere with your High BP medicine; and as always, if you are on any medications discuss any dramatic new diet choices with your doctor as it could affect the purpose of your medicine.)", "doctor_answer": "First check with your physician.Walking(1 hour) and  reducing your belly size sure will help"}

{"question": "Does anyone know about bacterial vaginitis?", "patient_answer": "I think you meant bacterial vaginosis\n\nBacterial vaginosis causes specific symptoms that are different from two other common types of vaginal infections, vaginal yeast infection and trichomoniasis. It is possible to have more than one type of vaginal infection at the same time. For more information on the other types, see the topics Vaginal Yeast Infections and Trichomoniasis.\n\nWhat is bacterial vaginosis?\n\nBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a change in the balance of bacteria that are normally present in the vagina, which can cause bothersome symptoms. BV is the most common cause of vaginal symptoms in women of childbearing age. \n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nThe most notable symptom of bacterial vaginosis is an excessive, bad-smelling, grayish-white vaginal discharge. A \"fishy\" smell, which is usually worse after sex, is a telltale sign of BV. However, about half of women with BV have no noticeable symptoms. 1 \n\nWhat risks are related to bacterial vaginosis?\n\nBV is of particular concern when you are pregnant. During pregnancy, BV is linked to complications, such as miscarriage, early (preterm) delivery, and pelvic infection after childbirth. 2 Uterine infection is a common trigger of preterm labor—BV could lead to this type of infection or could be a red flag for another problem causing preterm labor. Experts continue to research whether BV is a direct or indirect cause.\n\nHaving BV at the time of an invasive pelvic procedure (such as a cesarean delivery, hysterectomy, clinical abortion, endometrial biopsy, or intrauterine device (IUD) placement) increases your risk of developing a pelvic infection.\n\nHaving BV at the time of exposure to a sexually transmitted disease (including HIV) increases your risk of becoming infected. 3 \n\nWhat causes bacterial vaginosis?\n\nThe cause of BV is poorly understood. However, a number of known risk factors can lead to a drop in \"good\" lactobacillus bacteria in the vagina and an increase in less friendly bacteria, whose growth is usually kept in check by higher levels of lactobacillus. These risk factors include sexual activity, history of sexually transmitted disease, douching, and tampon, diaphragm, and IUD use. BV is more common among women who have multiple sex partners or female sex partners. \n\nBV is sometimes linked to hormonal changes; it is more common around the time of menstruation and is found in up to 23% of pregnant women. 4 \n\nHow is bacterial vaginosis diagnosed?\n\nBacterial vaginosis is diagnosed based on your symptoms, a pelvic examination, and a microscope inspection of a sample of vaginal discharge. When low numbers of lactobacillus organisms and higher numbers of other bacteria are present under the microscope, BV is diagnosed. \n\nHow is it treated?\n\nBV goes away without treatment about 25% of the time, so treatment isn't always necessary. 3 You will likely be screened and treated for BV if you: \n\nAre planning an invasive pelvic procedure that could result in an infection. \nHave BV symptoms, especially while pregnant. \nAre pregnant and have a history of preterm delivery that may have been caused by infection. \nHave symptoms that aren't going away on their own. \nBV is typically treated with antibiotic medication. Metronidazole (Flagyl) is the first-choice treatment for BV. If you aren't pregnant, you can choose to take it by mouth (orally) or by inserting it into the vagina; pregnant women are only treated orally. \n\nAntibiotic treatment for BV can lead to vaginal yeast infections because the medications change the balance of organisms in the vagina, allowing an excess of yeast to grow. You may be able to prevent this by regularly eating yogurt with active Lactobacillus acidophilus culture or taking L. acidophilus dietary supplements. \n\nSome women have success with using oral or vaginal lactobacillus by itself to treat bacterial vaginosis. 5 \n\nBecause BV is not caused by sexually transmitted organisms, treating your", "doctor_answer": "I know it can be similar to an STD-as in it can be transferred between partners.  So they may require your partner to be treated as well…although you don’t have to have a partner to get vaginitis. The cause tends to be a change in pH levels due to hormone fluctuations, stress, yeast infection treatments, etc.\n\nThe gel isn't nearly as bad as the oral antibiotics.  There's a white discharge and there can be some burning.\n\nMany times after you finish with the gel you end up with a yeast infection. (can be a vicious circle) If you have more problems after a couple weeks off the gel, make sure to have the Dr test if it is yeast or bacteria."}

GL!", "doctor_answer": "A low TSH result can indicate an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or excessive amounts of thyroid hormone medication in those who are being treated for an underactive (or removed) thyroid gland. Rarely, a low TSH result may indicate damage to the pituitary gland that prevents it from producing adequate amounts of TSH."}
{"question": "is marijuana good for you?", "patient_answer": "The answer to this is more difficult then your might imagine due to the difficulty in performing research on the actual effects of marijuana.\n\nThe overall answer is likely no, but it is less harmful then many might imagine.\n\nIt appears that marijuana is not good for your mental health, a variety of studies have shown a correlation of marijuana use with various mental illnesses, but this is only a correlation and has yet to be shown to be an actual cause of mental illness.\n\nHealth effects on the body and thought to be similar to that of tobacco use, yet studies have yet to show a link with lung cancer and other negative effects of tobacco use.

{"question": "What is an MRI?", "patient_answer": "MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a fairly new technique that has been used since the beginning of the 1980s.\n\nThe MRI scan uses magnetic and radio waves, meaning that there is no exposure to X-rays or any other damaging forms of radiation. \n\nHow does an MRI scanner work? \n\nThe patient lies inside a large, cylinder-shaped magnet. Radio waves 10,000 to 30,000 times stronger than the magnetic field of the earth are then sent through the body. This affects the body's atoms, forcing the nuclei into a different position. As they move back into place they send out radio waves of their own. The scanner picks up these signals and a computer turns them into a picture. These pictures are based on the location and strength of the incoming signals. \n\nOur body consists mainly of water, and water contains hydrogen atoms. For this reason, the nucleus of the hydrogen atom is often used to create an MRI scan in the manner described above. \n\nWhat does an MRI scan show? \n\nUsing an MRI scanner, it is possible to make pictures of almost all the tissue in the body. The tissue that has the least hydrogen atoms (such as bones) turns out dark, while the tissue that has many hydrogen atoms (such as fatty tissue) looks much brighter. By changing the timing of the radiowave pulses it is possible to gain information about the different types of tissues that are present. \n\nAn MRI scan is also able to provide clear pictures of parts of the body that are surrounded by bone tissue, so the technique is useful when examining the brain and spinal cord. \n\nBecause the MRI scan gives very detailed pictures it is the best technique when it comes to finding tumours (benign or malignant abnormal growths) in the brain. If a tumour is present the scan can also be used to find out if it has spread into nearby brain tissue. \n\nThe technique also allows us to focus on other details in the brain. For example, it makes it possible to see the strands of abnormal tissue that occur if someone has multiple sclerosis and it is possible to see changes occurring when there is bleeding in the brain, or find out if the brain tissue has suffered lack of oxygen after a stroke. \n\nThe MRI scan is also able to show both the heart and the large blood vessels in the surrounding tissue. This makes it possible to detect heart defects that have been building up since birth, as well as changes in the thickness of the muscles around the heart following a heart attack. The method can also be used to examine the joints, spine and sometimes the soft parts of your body such as the liver, kidneys and spleen. \n\nHow does an MRI scan differ from a CT scan? \n\nWith an MRI scan it is possible to take pictures from almost every angle, whereas a CT scan only shows pictures horizontally. There is no ionizing radiation (X-rays) involved in producing an MRI scan. MRI scans are generally more detailed, too. The difference between normal and abnormal tissue is often clearer on the MRI scan than on the CT scan. \n\nHow is an MRI scan performed? \n\nThe scan is usually done as an outpatient procedure, which means that the patient can go home after the test. During the scan it is important to lie completely still. For this reason it might be necessary to give a child an anaesthetic before they are tested. \n\nSince you are exposed to a powerful magnetic field during the MRI scan, it is important not to wear jewellery or any other metal objects.\n\nIt is also important for the patient to inform medical staff if they use electrical appliances, such as a hearing aid or pacemaker, or have any metal in their body such as surgical clips, but orthopaedic metalware such as artificial hips or bone screws is not normally a problem. \n\nIs an MRI scan dangerous? \n\nThere are no known dangers or side effects connected to an MRI scan. The test is not painful; you cannot feel it. Since radiation is not used, the procedure can be repeated without problems. There is a small theoretical risk to the foet", "doctor_answer": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - also called magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) - is a method of creating images of the inside of opaque organs in living organisms as well as detecting the amount of bound water in geological structures. It is primarily used to demonstrate pathological or other physiological alterations of living tissues and is a commonly used form of medical imaging. MRI has also found many novel applications outside of the medical and biological fields such as rock permeability to hydrocarbons and certain non-destructive testing methods such as produce and timber quality characterization."}

Strep infection may also cause a headache and abdominal pain. Less commonly, strep throat can cause a red skin rash, vomiting, loss of appetite, and a general feeling of discomfort or illness. Strep throat will go away in 3 to 7 days with or without treatment. However, strep throat is still treated with antibiotics even if they do not speed recovery. Antibiotics kill the strep bacteria, shorten the time you are contagious, and reduce the risk of complications, such as the infection spreading to other parts of your body. Antibiotics are effective in relieving symptoms of strep throat only if they are given within 48 to 72 hours after symptoms begin.", "doctor_answer": "Strep throat is more than just a scratchy throat.

You want to burn more than you eat.  It is dangerous to eat less than 1200 calories a day.  If you pick the right foods, you can fill up on about 1600 calories a day, then do an exercise you enjoy for about 45 minutes a day.  The exercise needs to be aerobic (make your heart go fast) for an extended period of time.

The male hormone androgen is present in both male and female bodies, especially during puberty. Androgen can enlarge the sebaceous glands in hair follicles, leading to greater amounts of oily sebum being produced.\n\nHeredity is also one of the causes of acne.

And the more severe the parents' condition, the greater the likelihood that the children's acne will also be severe.\n\nStress and Acne\nWhether stress plays a role in acne or not is an issue of considerable debate.

{"question": "how to loose weight safely?", "patient_answer": "Diet and Exercise is it.  There is no magical special way to take weight off quickly that will ever stick.  Go to mypyramid.gov and print off your own food guide pyramid.  This will tell you what and how much you should eat each day.  Eat a healthy diet consisting of 500 calories less than you need to sustain your current weight, and exercise enough to burn 500 calories each day.  This will enable you to lose 2 pounds each week.  Two pounds is healthy weight loss.  If you are very obese you can cut a few more calories and loose a little more each week and still have it be healthy.  Also, keep in mind as you loose weight you'll need to constantly adjust your diet.  The less you weigh the less calories you need to take in.", "doctor_answer": "I can tell you exactly how to do it, but you have to want to hear the answer.  Sharing my experience might be the best way to explain.  I had a sort of personal epiphany about 3 months ago, and I came to the realization that we, especially as Americans, put a lot of stuff into our mouths that isn't healthy. And I'm not just talking about fat and sugar; I'm also talking about artificial sweeteners and fake fat etc.  The decision I came to was that no food or drink, no matter how sumptuous, was worth the extra weight that could come with it.  Nothing.  I stopped eating anything that wasn't good for me. When I feel like something sweet, I put frozen strawberries in a blender, then add non-fat milk and blend until very smooth. If it's not quite sweet enough, add just a tiny bit of sugar or honey.  You can also add yogurt, bananas, blueberries, raspberries, and I'm sure a host of other fruit. I started eating the most minimum serving sizes. So far I have lost 24 lbs, and 4 inches off of my waist.  Please know that I'm not judging you, as I was in the same boat a few months ago. Of course different things work for different people, but basically it's a mind over matter thing.  Some people find food logs to be helpful.

{"question": "what is good to take for a SINUS HEADACHE It's really bad in the morning  HELP....?", "patient_answer": "The key to relieving the symptoms is to reduce sinus swelling and inflammation and facilitate mucous drainage from the sinuses. \nThere are several at-home steps that help prevent sinus headache or alleviate its pain. They include: \n\nBreathe moist air: Relief for a sinus headache can be achieved by humidifying the dry air environment. This can be done by using a steam vaporizer or cool-mist humidifier, steam from a basin of hot water, or steam from a hot shower. \n\nAlternate hot and cold compresses: Place a hot compress across your sinuses for three minutes, and then a cold compress for 30 seconds. Repeat this procedure three times per treatment, two to six times a day. \n\nNasal irrigation: Some believe that when nasal irrigation or rinse is performed, mucus, allergy creating particles and irritants such as pollens, dust particles, pollutants and bacteria are washed away, reducing the inflammation of the mucous membrane. Normal mucosa will fight infections and allergies better and will reduce the symptoms. Nasal irrigation helps shrink the sinus membranes and thus increases drainage. There are several over-the-counter nasal rinse products available. Consult your ear, nose, and throat specialist for directions on making a home nasal rinse or irrigation solution.\n\nOver-the-counter medications: Some over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are highly effective in reducing sinus headache pain. The primary ingredient in most OTC pain relievers is aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, or a combination of them. The best way to choose a pain reliever is by determining which of these ingredients works best for you.\n\nDecongestants: Sinus pressure headaches caused by allergies are usually treated with decongestants and antihistamines. In difficult cases, nasal steroid sprays may be recommended.\n\nAlternative medicine: Chinese herbalists use Magnolia Flower as a remedy for clogged sinus and nasal passages. In conjunction with other herbs, such as angelica, mint, and chrysanthemum, it is often recommended for upper respiratory tract infections and sinus headaches, although its effectiveness for these problems has not been scientifically confirmed.", "doctor_answer": "use steam inhalator to clear nose clog"}
{"question": "is there a yoga pose for depression?", "patient_answer": "Studies indicate that regular exercise too, including yoga asanas and breathing, can help some people ease the symptoms of mild to moderate forms of depression. \n\nOf course, one major hurdle in using exercise to alleviate depression is motivation, or lack of it. Most depressed people don't really feel much like getting out of bed in the morning, much less exercising. Then too, failure to see the exercise program through can make a depressed person feel even worse. So start off slowly, and be sure to choose an exercise that you really enjoy; if possible, exercise with a supportive partner or group.

{"question": "where a good places to get help on depression?", "patient_answer": "Try this website. I have depression, so I tried this website. Good luck", "doctor_answer": "I understand your desire to learn about depression and remedies for it. I have three things that have\ngotten me through times when I've been depressed, and\nthey're all gentle solutions that I think will suit an\nintelligent person like yourself. \n\n1 - The first is what Freud calls the \"talking cure\".\nHe insists that it must be performed by a\npsychoanalyst who you are paying for, but actually\nI've performed it by writing in a diary. The key is to\nbe very honest, and try to find connections that you\nmight otherwise be supressing, because these are the\nareas that need work. For example, what's the first\nthing that pops into your mind when you think of\n\"depression\"? If the answer is \"flying a kite\", then\nfollow the chain... What do you think of when you\nthink of \"kite\" and \"flying\"... You'll be surprised\nhow quickly this takes you right down to an event in\nyour childhood or an unresolved conflict that might\nhave happened a year ago.\n\n2 - Looking for lies. A chair cannot make you\ndepressed. A lampshade cannot make you depressed. Only\nanother person can make you depressed. I believe it is\nbecause a chair and a lampshade cannot lie. Only a\nperson can lie. Depression, it seems to me, comes from\nbelieving a lie. That conflict (between reality and\nthe lie) takes up so much mental energy to maintain,\nit drains you as a whole. You may find, after using\ntechnique #1, that it leads to you to this conclusion\n#2. For example, after free associating your way to an\nevent, you might find that it was when someone told\nyou that you weren't worth a hill of beans. The\nproblem is not that they insulted you, the problem is\nthat you believed the lie. Beware, giving up on a lie\nthat we've believed in for a long time is tougher than\nit sounds.\n\n3 - This one is going to sound goofy, especially after\nwading in deeply with the other two techniques. Get\nsome light to shine on the cells in the back of your\neyes. Go outside for an extended period of time\nwithout sunglasses (no need to stare at the sun or a\nlight-bulb, indirect light will do). Use one of those\ngentle light therapy products like www.everlyte.com .\nTake a trip on a sailboat. Spend a few hours in open\nfields on sunny days. It's those cells in the eyes\nthat produce much of the chemical that pills and\nherbal remedies seek to replace, but the cells in the\neyes put the chemicals where they are needed, in your\nbrain, and not in your stomach and everywhere else.\nThis third technique will help you with the other two,\nallowing you to think clearly, and get out from being\nstuck in a loop.\n\nI hope this \"whole-istic\" answer is as helpful to you\nas it has been to me over the years. A gentle look at\nthe whole picture is often better than a sledgehammer\nto just one piece of the problem."}

{"question": "Is drinkin tap water safe?", "patient_answer": "Unless your local health department has said otherwise (you would definitely know) then yes assuming you are on city water (chlorinated).  If you are on a well then you would have to get it tested professionally before you could declare it to be safe.  Many different region's water tastes different from another regions and some of it can taste downright BAD, but it would depend on what you are used to.  Impurities in water can be removed by MANY processes and I would have no way of knowing what process is used where you live.  Just a few ways are: chlorination, reverse osmosis, filtration, ozonation(for taste), distillation(tastes bad but won't hurt you), and under extreme circumstances (survival situations!) water from a running water source (river, stream, creek) can be drank after treatment with iodide but it really tastes bad...\nhope that might have helped a bit", "doctor_answer": "Q: How can I find out if my tap water is safe to drink?\nA: Because of water's different sources and the different ways in which water is treated, the taste and quality of drinking water varies from place to place. Over 90 percent of water systems meet EPA's standards for tap water quality. The best source of specific information about your drinking water is your water supplier. Water suppliers that serve the same people year-round are required to send their customers an annual water quality report (sometimes called a consumer confidence report). Contact your water supplier to get a copy or see if your report is posted on-line. For additional information, visit EPA's web site's on local drinking water (provides links to state and local sources of water quality information) and drinking water and health (provides information on drinking water contaminants and their health effects). \n\nQ. How will I know if my water isn't safe to drink?\nA: Your water supplier must notify you by newspaper, mail, radio, TV, or hand-delivery if your water doesn't meet EPA or state standards or if there is a waterborne disease emergency. The notice will describe any precautions you need to take, such as boiling your water. Follow the advice of your water supplier if you ever receive such a notice. The most common drinking water emergency is contamination by disease-causing germs. Boiling your water for one minute will kill these germs. You can also use common household bleach or iodine to disinfect your drinking water at home in an emergency, such as a flood (see EPA's emergency disinfection fact sheet for specific directions on how to disinfect your drinking water in an emergency)."}

{"question": "Do researchers have the cure for cancer?", "patient_answer": "Generally speaking, no.  It also seems unlikely to me that there will ever be a single cure for \"cancer\".

And people are cured of cancer every day by some of these treatments (including surgical removal, etc.) Still, early diagnosis is often key. \n\nWhile diet and exercise is important (nutrition can play an important role), the last poster would have you believe there is a miricale cure being supressed by the government and big pharma.  Right....", "doctor_answer": "They have a cure, but they cannot put it on the market because pharmaceautical companies would lose money.  They always give chemo therapy which destroys cancer, but also destroys your body cells.  If they found out that a certain tree bark can be used to cure cancer 90% of the time, they wouldnt say a word.  They would just keep their mouths shut and continue administering drugs that prolong your life for another year and keep collecting on you till you die.  There are medicines out there that can cure cancer even when doctors have given up.  And its not a hit or miss thing.  Up to 90% of cancer patients who have late stage cancer can still survive, even after doctors have given up on them.  Chemo therapy, will not let you live another 5 or 6 years even though the cancer is gone.  what do you live with if your body is deteriorated with their chemo?  And the thing is, your body will deteriorate.  If some people kill half of their cancer with chemo, what about the other half of your body cells?  They die also.  The other remedies that are on the market are not even allowed to post labels on their medicines.  They can only be sold as health products and vitamins, and not a cure for cancer, even though they do cure cancer.  Why is that then?  Because if they were labled cancer medicine, people would flock over there to buy them.  But, the government cant regulate these medicines.  What if it was a mushroom that everybody can grow?  See, the medical community wants to profit from you till the day you die.  Do look up cesium chloride, green algae, oxygen drops, paw paw, and everything else that you can dig up.  Health vitamin websites and the like is where you should start.  There are even some doctors scattered across the USA who can almost garauntee that you live, if its only 2nd stage cancer.  They can even cure 3rd stage cancer at a 85%-90% survival rate, so what makes you think they cant cure cancer?  There are some chinese herbs, but, I suggest you look up cesium chloride and oxygen drops first."}
{"question": "When i run out of Bottled water to drink , Can i drink tap water microwaved for a minute or so?", "patient_answer": "Depends on why you're drinking bottled water.  If it's because the tap water is unsafe, then you need to bring tap water to a full boil (and then let it cool!) before you drink it to kill any buggies in it.  If you're not drinking tap water because you don't like the taste, then microwaving will do nothing - try adding some lemon?  :)  And there's no point in choosing bottled water over tap to try to be \"healthier\" - repeated studies have shown that bottled water is in absolutely no way more healthy than tap water. (Unless you're someplace with unsafe tap water of course).", "doctor_answer": "I agree with Mandy.  Keep in mind that there are two concerns when trying to purify water.  One, bacteria, will be helped with heat.  But as mentioned, public utility water in the US is chlorinated to kill bacteria.  The second concern is chemicals, including the chlorination added in cities.  This is not helped by heat but a simple water filter that you can screw on to your tap or a pitcher filter is quite effective at ridding these chemicals which can cause bad taste and smell.  But these filters have no affect on bacteria which is why you don't want to use them with river or lake water."}

{"question": "I'm tired all the time; I've tried getting different hours of sleep, but nothing helps. What should I do?", "patient_answer": "Persistent fatigue which is not alleviated by sleep is a characteristic of many chronic conditions. Debilitating fatigue can also occur without an obvious illness and, after six months, is classified as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Milder forms have been dubbed ‘TATT’ (tired all the time).\n\nFatigue can often be traced back to a viral infection, but this may not be the only culprit. It usually results from a combination of several factors, such as poor diet, overwork, a viral or bacterial infection, bereavement, stress, physical exhaustion, exposure to toxins etc. Its does not respond readily to modern drugs, so many sufferers turn towards alternative and complementary medicine in their quest for a solution.\n\nThe treatment strategy which has worked with my patients is to close all possible avenues where diet or lifestyle may be inadequate by using a multi-dimensional approach. This means making an effort to ensure an above-average nutrient-intake by eating a healthy diet coupled with taking a range of good-quality supplements. In addition, I prescribe herbal medicine with immune-stimulating properties. \n\nNutrition\n\nIt is especially important for people with fatigue to choose a healthy diet. However, even when eating in this way, a person with fatigue may not reach daily nutrient-intake targets because of poor absorption and poor appetite due to lack of exercise. Hence, nutrient supplementation is an important, essential strategy to augment a healthy diet. A supplement programme for fatigue should start with a basic ‘multi’. This will provide most of the vitamins and minerals needed by the body at essential requirement levels. However, it will not contain enough calcium and magnesium, because these are required in much higher quantities than will fit into a single ‘multi’. Extra calcium will be required if fewer than three portions of dairy products are eaten per day. More magnesium is required if the intake of wholegrains, nuts, beans and seeds is low. (In fact, magnesium deficiency is very common in fatigue.) It is best to take these two minerals together in a good bone formula in the ratio of 2:1 calcium to magnesium\n\nA group of symptoms often accompanying fatigue is related to inflammation. This shows up as catarrh, skin rash, dry skin or eadaches. There are two approaches to reduce inflammation: increasing intake of (a) antioxidants and (b) omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. Therefore, extra vitamin C is likely to be useful. For optimal nutrition, take at least 500mg daily as a supplement which, again, is much higher than will go into a single ‘multi’ tablet. \n\nI have written about the importance of getting the right balance of essential fatty acids in a previous Healthspan magazine.5 For fatigue sufferers, as well as having anti-inflammatory properties, it is the direct benefit that omega-3 fatty acids have on boosting normal immune function that is particularly important.\n\nHerbs\n\nFor those with CFS, herbal medicine seems to have a very special role in normalising the immune system, which cannot be effected by essential nutrients alone. In fact, the more severe and persistent the fatigue, the more important it seems to be to augment the nutritional approach above with immune-supportive herbs. Since herbal treatments for CFS have to be individually prescribed, a visit to a professional is necessary. Contact the College of Practitioners (01424 776780) or the National Institute of Medical Herbalists (01392 426022) to find a registered herbal practitioner in your area. Herbal prescriptions normally include those with outspoken traditional use for supporting the immune and nervous systems.

Currently medical tourists are traveling in large numbers to South and Southeast Asia, the East Indies, and South America, and North Africa although other places are beginning to tailor services aimed specifically at medical tourists as well."}

{"question": "Is it possible to drink too much water? I'm drinking about 9 glasses/day.?", "patient_answer": "Yes, it is possible to drink too much water (called \"water intoxication), but this is an extreme case seen rarely. They occur in unusual circumstances and/or in patients who develop a water/salt disturbance or have underlying metabolic problems. Sometimes we see it in patients with psychiatric problems. Drinking 9 glasses/day is quite healthy and will not harm you.", "doctor_answer": "As we learned from the University of Florida's College of Health and Human Performance, there's a condition known as \"water intoxication,\" or hyponatremia, which isn't uncommon among marathoners and triathletes. \n\nAs these athletes consume large amounts of water over the course of a race, blood plasma increases and dilutes the salt content of the blood. While this is happening, the athlete is also losing salt by sweating. Consequently, the amount of salt available to the body tissues decreases, and, over time, the loss interferes with brain, heart, and muscle function. \n\nAccording to the experts at iVillage, consumption of large amounts of water is often associated with obsessive-compulsive behaviors. When a person consumes too much of this good thing, essential electrolytes in the blood stream become diluted and affect the control of the heart beat. \n\nHealthy adults require approximately three quarts of fluid each day, half of which comes from food and half from beverages. Drinking 8 to 12 glasses a day should have your body working on all cylinders."}
{"question": "Why is Alcohol Better Than Smoking In Peoples Eyes as It Has caused More Death and Hardships?", "patient_answer": "alcohol is a personal decision+effect and smoking affects more the enviroment than the smoker+can corrupe by this way others to start smoking.", "doctor_answer": "Frankly smoking and drinking to me are idiotic.  Polluting your body in such a manner, though it may be a personal choice, should be done in your own home, in your own room, where you can not possibly interact with anyone else.\n\nThe reason for this in my opinion, is that 2nd hand smoke from smoking kills just as much as regular smoking.  And drinking puts others in danger from your wild attitude swings, to temper inflarments.\n\nDrinking and smoking both cause harm to the general public, so, i'm sorry, but to me both of them are wrong.\n\nIf I were to choose which would be worse, i would say alchol.  The main reason for this is that people who are 'knackered up' are very dangerous for a short period of time (untill they sober up) and are just fine untill they drink again.  So, the problem is transitory.  But due to that exact nature, it can become increasingly difficult to control a person who drinks quite a bit of booze.  So this makes for an unpredictable person.\n\nSmoking, on the other hand, is a long term effect, and thus isn't considered a direct threat to most people.  To me, however it is considered disrespectful, and a statment that you want me to die.  But, to others as the effects happen over a long period of time, and chances of it actually affecting your mental state to make you hurt someone is rare, then it isn't considered as big a threat as drinking.\n\nI just dont condone either.  To me, th ey are both wrong."}

{"question": "What are adrenal glands?What are symptoms of adrenal dysfunction?", "patient_answer": "The adrenal glands are orange-colored endocrine glands which are located on the top of both kidneys. The adrenal glands are triangular shaped and measure about one-half inch in height and 3 inches in length. Each gland consists of a medulla (the center of the gland) which is surrounded by the cortex. The medulla is responsible for producing epinephrine and norepinephrine (adrenaline). The adrenal cortex produces other hormones necessary for fluid and electrolyte (salt) balance in the body such as cortisone and aldosterone. The adrenal cortex also makes sex hormones but this only becomes important if overproduction is present. \n\n\nIf your adrenal glands are underactive it's called Addison's disease.\n\nIf they're over active it's called Cushing's Syndrom.\n\nSymptoms of Addison's disease are:\n\nweakness \nfatigue \ndizziness \ndark skin \nblack freckles \nbluish-black discoloration around the nipples, mouth, rectum, scrotum, or vagina \nweight loss \ndehydration \nlack of appetite \nmuscle aches \nnausea \nvomiting \ndiarrhea \nintolerance to cold \n\nSymptoms of Cushing's Disease are:\nupper body obesity \nround face \nincreased fat around neck \nthinning arms and legs \nfragile and thin skin \nstretch marks on abdomen, thighs, buttocks, arms, and breasts \nbone and muscle weakness \nsevere fatigue \nhigh blood pressure \nhigh blood sugar \nirritability and anxiety \nexcess hair growth in women \nirregular or stopped menstrual cycles in women \nreduced sex drive and fertility in men", "doctor_answer": "I don't know."}

I would not recommend withdrawl as it has a very high rate of failure, and is like not using anything at all.", "doctor_answer": "Send your woman to the doctor to find out which pill will work best for her.  You wouldn't have to pull out if she is on the pill."}
{"question": "my mother is bipolar does that mean that i coould be also?", "patient_answer": "Bipolar disorder appears to run in families. The rate of suicide is higher in people who have bipolar disorder than in the general population. In fact, people with bipolar disorder are about twice as likely to commit suicide as those suffering from major depression (12% to 6%).\n\nThe rate of prevalence of bipolar disorder is roughly equal in men and women. Lifetime risk of bipolar I disorder is often quoted as around 1%, but when bipolar II is included the true rate may be around 4%.[13]\n\nMore than two-thirds of people with bipolar disorder have at least one close relative with the disorder or with unipolar major depression, indicating that the disease has a heritable component. Studies seeking to identify the genetic basis of bipolar disorder indicate that susceptibility stems from multiple genes. Scientists are continuing their search for these genes using advanced genetic analytic methods and large samples of families affected by the illness. The researchers are hopeful that identification of susceptibility genes for bipolar disorder, and the brain proteins they code for, will make it possible to develop better treatments and preventive interventions targeted at the underlying illness process.", "doctor_answer": "I wouldn't bank on it although it is a possibility. The random ordering of your parents DNA which created your DNA is a game of chance. And although I'll be the first to say being bipolar is not fun, it isn't the end of the world. Medication works, and they are constantly finding new drugs that work even better, and constantly improving their methods of determining how the brain works in a bipolar person. It is concieveable that 10- 20 years from now they will have drugs that will get rid of all sysmptoms. Good luck and love your mother."}

{"question": "how to treat an ear infection?", "patient_answer": "Hi!  I'm an Audiologist and work in an Ear, Nose and Throat Doctors' office.  There are different kinds of ear infections. Swimmers ear is in the external ear canal and is typically treated with ear drops and keeping the ear dry.  \n\n     A middle ear infection is a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum and often accompanies a head cold, or in young children can occur during teething, or in infancy can even happen if the baby is bottle fed while laying flat.  To relieve the discomfort, OTC pain relievers are usually recommended, and it often helps to apply heat, such as a hot water bottle, against the ear.  If accompanied by fever, antibiotics are often prescribed and it is VERY important to administer them properly for the full dosage to ensure that ALL the bacteria have been killed.  Otherwise, the bacteria can regrow and may become resistant to the milder antibiotics.  \n\n     If the infections keep coming back, or if the fluid doesn't drain even after the antibiotics have killed the bacteria, surgical options may be considered.  This is especially true in the case of young children, if the decrease in hearing is not resolving because it can effect the child's speech development.  The surgeon makes an incision in the eardrum, draws out the fluid, cleans the middle ear space, and usually places a tube through the incision.  The tube simply maintains an opening through the ear drum to maintain equal air pressure in the middle ear.  Most tubes are designed to fall out of the eardrum as the healing process occurs -- usually about six months after surgery.   The surgery is very common and is done as a same-day procedure in most cases, only because the space is so small that the patient must be very still.  With adults, many specialists will perform the surgery in their office using only a local anestetic.   If the child snores a lot or has other trouble breathing or frequent sore throats then inflammed or enlarged adenoids or tonsils may be blocking the Eustacian tube and preventing the fluid from draining.\n\n     My son had chronic ear infections as an infant, even though he was breastfed and I was diligent about administering his medications properly.  His father had ear infections his whole life, so I guess he just inherited the tendancy for ear infections from his dad.  His first set of tubes was around his first birthday.  The hardest part was not feeding him before and after -- he was so mad and he didn't understand.  Another set of tubes and an adenoisectomy were done when he was five.  Then he started getting frequent throat ifections so we had to remove the tonsils a couple years later.  He's now 14 and only gets earaches occasionally.\n\n     An inner ear infection often causes dizziness and sometimes ringing in the ear and/or sudden hearing loss.  If there is a sudden onset of such symptoms it is important to see a specialist ASAP, because the sooner one starts treatment, the better the cance of recovery.", "doctor_answer": "first of all do not get any water in there. cover your ear with cotton. any more water in there will add to the infection, and feed on it.You can go to the drug store and get ear drops, and first warm up the bottle in a cup of warm water. If you get them alot, you should be getting tubes in your ears, and try not to get water in your ears."}

Usually a nebulizer is used as a last resort unless you have a disease that warrants it.\n\nA pill like Singular is often used for both allergies and asthma. An inhaler is used for asthma.

{"question": "What causes vertigo?", "patient_answer": "too much MJ.. haha", "doctor_answer": "Infections (viral or bacterial), head injury, disorders of blood circulation affecting the inner ear or brain, certain medications, and aging may change our balance system and result in a balance problem. Individuals who have illnesses, brain disorders, or injuries of the visual or skeletal systems, such as eye muscle imbalance and arthritis, may also experience balance difficulties. A conflict of signals to the brain about the sensation of movement can cause motion sickness (for instance, when an individual tries to read while riding in a car). Some symptoms of motion sickness are dizziness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, and generalized discomfort. Balance disorders can be due to problems in any of four areas:\n\nPeripheral vestibular disorder, a disturbance in the labyrinth. \nCentral vestibular disorder, a problem in the brain or its connecting nerves. \nSystemic disorder, a problem of the body other than the head and brain. \nVascular disorder, or blood flow problems."}

{"question": "how can vegetarians get more energy?", "patient_answer": "ENERGY NEEDS\nThe primary concern for the vegetarian athlete is obtaining adequate energy and protein, the group most at risk of this is the vegan. As in all athletes, needs for energy and protein are higher than the non-athlete. A high carbohydrate diet is essential to optimize muscle glycogen stores, which are the preferred source of energy during prolonged activity.\n\nUsually protein intake in the vegetarian athlete is lower than the meat-eating athlete and carbohydrate will then need to be 60-65 percent of total calories so protein is not used for energy. Depending on the activity and duration 6-10 grams (gm) of carbohydrate per kilogram (1 kg) (1 kg = 2.2 pounds) of body weight is practiced. This will spare protein from being used as an energy source, carbohydrates in the vegetarian diet come from whole grains, beans and legumes (which are also a protein source), fruits, vegetables and dairy if the athlete is not a vegan.", "doctor_answer": "eat more protein"}

{"question": "What is a less toxic alternative to Chemo therapy for breast cancer treatment in a woman?", "patient_answer": "To be honest, chemotherapy is not a cancer treatment.  Here is the situation.  Chemo can take care of the problem right away, but the doctor always says that, some can live an extended 2 years, or 3 years.  And some die right away from the chemicals.  This is with late stages of cancer.  Now, for early stages, it helps the problem but your health is deteriorated. They say that chemo affects the cancer and your normal body cells.  How many people you know, who have had late stages of cancer, and lived through it pass 5 yours with chemo therapy?  I bet you that you have never even heard of it.  Even if someone has, how many people is that compared to that masses?  The problem with other medicines is that the pharmaceautical companies cannot control that product.  What if it was tree bark say for instance.  How many people do you know will buy the pills if they can just walk up to any tree and bite a piece off to save themselves?  See?  So, USA doctors are familiar with these remedies, but they do not talk about it.  Try asking your doctor about green algae, or cesium chloride, or paw paw, etc etc.  Then they start to talk.  Otherwise, they wont say a word.  And if you dont know, how can you ask?  So, the doctors lips are sealed tight.  The individual doctors on the other hand are sometimes scared to talk about it.  It is because, if they open their mouths, they would be facing the whole medical community.  Alot of them go into the medical field to help people, and some go in it for money.  But, the top ranking ones in control are all in it for money.  If not, they would have never gotten their position.  I do not suggest you go with chemo therapy.  You can look up some alternative medicine to cancer and they are all over the place on the net.  The best ranked one is cesium chloride, paw paw, and along with others.  Some health websites even have a place where you can go and tell them your stage of cancer and which type of cancer, and they will sell you a package based on your individual problem.  There are also some doctors scattered all over the USA who specialize in cancer.  You never hear about them right?  Well, they wont be bothered by the medical community if they do a small operation without much advertising.  But, they all report about 90% survival rates on cancers that regular cancer doctors give up on.  And if that doctor didnt give up, do you expect to live anyways?  No.  I speak out to you because I dont want you to die like the two of my friends who have already died.  Certain doctors even said that they could cure it with 80% survival rate.  But, I didnt have the money to help them.  So, I am speaking out in hopes that nothing happens to you and you survive.  Regardless of your stage of cancer.  Cesium chloride is what works best.  Look it up, its everywhere.  Even oxygen drops help.  You can use them both at the same time.  The thing is with these alternatives is that, some of them make you feel extremely bad at the beginning, but after a while you get used to it, and then you are gone with the cancer before you know it.  So dont feel discouraged.  Oxygen drops keep cancer from growing because your body can live with more oxygen.  As a matter of fact, it helps circulate your blood.  Cancer cannot live at the sight of oxygen.  It has been said that not enough oxygen is what causes cancer. I dont know what the cause is, because there are many causes.  But, cesium chloride and oxygen drops will take care of it.  And one more thing, some of these remedies cannot be sold as a cancer treatment.  So, they are sold as vitamins.  But, in their website, they are allowed to say what it cures.  But, their labels cannot say a word about cancer.  So, you should start in the vitamin section of the internet.  Good luck my friend.", "doctor_answer": "Do some research or talk to a doctor about the drug Herceptin by Genentech. It's a relatively new cancer drug to fight breast cancer and they have seen good success. I'm not sure if it's used in combination or instead of chemo though.\n\nhttp://www.gene.com/gene/products/information/oncology/herceptin/index.jsp"}

{"question": "How can you get rid of reoccurring mouth sores?", "patient_answer": "Depending upon which kind...Canker or cold sore?   (in the mouth) Canker sores are often connected to stomach problems bacteria or stress.  Look up apthous ulcers and stomatitis so you can better understand them and help yourself.  If you also have stomach problems of any sort, it could be related.  Stress, poor diet(acidic foods such as coffee, chocolate (sorry) meats and vinegars can add to the problem) or any bacterial infection could be contributing to these sores.  \n\nIf it's cold sores(on the mouth), LYSINE pills are good for suppressing viruses(herpes simplex).  There are also LYSINE balms for this topically.  \n\nFor Canker sores, soothing and healing the stomach lining helps.  You can  look into is DGL-deglycerrized licorice.   This excellent supplement helps heal the stomach lining which can then help with canker sores.  I used to get them all the time...I also had constant stomach aches due to stress!!  So maybe this will help??  Teas made from mucalents like slippery elm, marshmallow can help soothe the stomach.  Ginger is also good for the stomach.  As far as the sore itself, avoid acidic foods, keep the mouth clean.   Goldenseal powder(yuck but effective) is a good natural antibacterial/biotic to heal wounds.  Use a little on the wound once a day.

Lower back pain that was sometime so unbearable I couldn't get off of my bed, or couldn't put on my own socks because of the pain.  Went to the doctor and the B^%$# told me it was because I was over-weight... at 5'3 and 150lbs I took his word lightly and went to another doctor who ordered ex-rays.  Turns out I have scoleosis or something like that.  Now there are many different reasons people get lower back pain.  My doc said it was because of a tendency of sitting in bad postures.  so doing little changes like sitting all the way back in chairs and plantin my feet firm on the ground rather than crossing them under my chair has helped alot.  Also, I started excersizing.  Just walking an hour a day three times a week has made a difference.   You have to look into what you are doing that's throwing your back off and causing you pain.  Go see a doctor, I know how bad it can get.  Also for extreeme pain I recommend boiling some water with epson salt, wetting a towel with that and placing it on your back as hot as you can take it.  It helps to relax the muscles and help alieve any inflamation.... sorry if this is long, I just know how bad it can get.  Ibuprofen would help too if you know it's swolen.

{"question": "Are water fasts bad for you?", "patient_answer": "This is an interesting question especially in a time when health has become so commercial. Fasts are in general not unhealthy and are healthy to help the body clear itself of wastes. Fasting has been tied to a lot of religeous beliefs because a lot of people feel better when it is finished. Maybe thats because the body is so happy to be fed again! But seriously a lot of people are eating way too much as it is and fasting would really benefit your life. If you were to describe the purpose of your fast it would be easier to discuss but when I wanted to lose weight I drank water to fill my stomach and it helped out. \nThat being said there are limits to everything including fasts. There is a thing called the BMI or Body Mass Index that works as a good indicator of your health. Calcium levels should be a major factor for your worry since Osteoporosis is frequent now days. Calcium is easy to get in milk (with lactose sugars) and meat (commonly high in fats.) So if you do decide to go on a diet talk to your Physician about it and come with a plan that they can help you modify if it isn't healthy.

{"question": "which is better for my back pain 10mg percecet or oxycotin?", "patient_answer": "You should rotate on 6 to 12 month basis.  I would also advise you to ask your doctor about Morphine XR 30mg or 60mg 3 times daily.  Plus, 15mg MSIR up to 5 a day should be more than enough. Tolerance will occur though, and then you discuss an appropriate switch with your physician.   Oxycontin is long-term, extended release, whereas Percocet 10/325 mg is a short-term four hour treatment.  Oxycodone and Percocet are fundamentally the same.  Vicodin is Hydrocodone, and Oxycontin is the long-term version of Oxycodone.  Therefore, the Morphine, Fentanyl Patch, or Methadone 10mg (approx.) 3 to 5 a day.  \n\nThe only other solution is an internal pump to regulate this medicine.  I recommend you see a Pain Specialist to help you better tackle the situation. Best of luck, and I hope you get back to health.\n\n-Cybersnark", "doctor_answer": "Oh gosh!

{"question": "How do you stop snoring?", "patient_answer": "Here are some tips.\nLosing weight. Many people who snore are overweight. Weight loss can help reduce the narrowing of the airway and possibly reduce or eliminate snoring. \nLimiting the use of alcohol and medications. Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol or taking certain medications, especially sleeping pills or tranquilizers, before sleep may worsen snoring. \nGoing to bed at the same time each night and getting plenty of sleep. Snoring may be more frequent when you have not had enough sleep. \nSleeping on your side. Sleeping on your side may eliminate snoring. Try sewing a pocket in the middle of the back of your pajama top, putting a tennis ball into the pocket, and stitching it closed. This will help keep you from sleeping on your back. \nPromptly treating breathing problems. Breathing problems caused by colds or allergies can disturb airflow, leading to snoring. \nUsing nasal strips. Nasal strips, such as Breathe Right, widen the nostrils and improve airflow.", "doctor_answer": "There is also a less known, but very effective way to stop snoring. It is to exercise the throat, the tongue, and the jaw muscles so the breathing passage will widen and stay open when you sleep. Singing and practicing yoga may be other ways to stop snoring."}

It is estimated that there are between 90 and 200 cases per year in Canada, and about 20 to 30 percent of these are fatal.\n\nThe symptoms of flesh-eating disease include a high fever, and a red, severely painful swelling that feels hot and spreads rapidly. The skin may become purplish and then die. There may be extensive tissue destruction. Sometimes the swelling starts at the site of a minor injury, such as a small cut or bruise, but in other cases there is no obvious source of infection.\n\nFlesh-eating disease can be caused by a number of different bacteria, including group A streptococcus (GAS). GAS is a very common bacteria. Many people carry it in the throat or on their skin without getting sick. It is the same bacteria that causes strep throat, and can also cause impetigo, scarlet fever and rheumatic fever. In rare instances, GAS will cause serious illnesses, including pneumonia, meningitis, blood poisoning (bacteremia), streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome and flesh-eating disease.\n\nFew people who come into contact with GAS will develop a serious disease. The bacteria are normally spread through close personal contact, such as kissing or sharing cutlery with someone who is infected. People who are ill, such as those with strep throat or skin infections, are most likely to spread the bacteria. People who carry the bacteria, but have no symptoms, are much less contagious."}

{"question": "How do you recover from co-dependency?", "patient_answer": "If you really want to recover from co-dependency, you need to know exactly what you're doing to encourage,  and most of all WHY you do it.\n\nThere are support groups for all types of co-dependency that will acquaint you with the 12 steps, as designed by Alcoholic Anonymous, and prior to that seven of them were actually found in the Bible.\n\nIt's all about your own spirituality or lack of such.  Since you know you're behaving as a co-dependent, you probably feel as you mentioned in your question, that it's easier to do it and hope it will all just disappear.  That's a childish way of thought.  Nothing as serious as drug or alcohol abuse will 'just go away'.  If it were that simple, people would stop using when they found it didn't bring the joy they once hoped for.\n\nWe need to learn the steps to self-love and relinquishing control as a beginning.  You control your wife by fulfilling her need for pain-killers.  If you didn't do that, do you fear deep down that she might leave you, or at least not acknowledge you as you wish?  If you truly loved yourself, you wouldn't feel that needy because you would be happy with only yourself, if that's what the outcome would be to refusing to help your wife get what she wants.\n\nThe spiritual basis is very important.  You need to have a strong and sincere faith to be able to make the changes neccessary for a better life for your family and yourself.\n\nPlease locate a Narcotics Anonymous or Alcoholics Anonymous meeting group and encourage your wife to attend.  You, on the other hand must attend the AlAnon or Naranon meetings for your own support and information. It will widen your self-knowledge and bring you closer to your God belief. This is not a 5 minute or 5 day recovery program.  It is a lifetime committment for your wife and perhaps you as well.

{"question": "what causes itchy hands?", "patient_answer": "Itchy hands are most often associated with a skin condition or rash. The commonest of these is eczema. This itching could be due to an allergy to something you have come into contact. Common allergy causing agents are household detergents or factors linked to your occupation. \n\n\nIt is very unlikely that the itching is related to your circulation. There are other conditions that give rise to itching but the itch tends to be more generalised all over the body. You will need to visit your GP so he or she can assess your hands and advise you on the likely cause and treatment. If you are worried about anything in particular, it is very important that you tell you're doctor.", "doctor_answer": "You could be allergic to something. It's common that your hands are too dry or irritated by overuse of water and soap. This is only one possible reason, however."}
{"question": "Do cockroaches transmit diseases?", "patient_answer": "Cockroaches are the most repulsive of all household pests. Not only do they look disgusting, but they act disgusting. According to the National Pest Control Association cockroaches can contaminate food and transmit disease\n\ncarrying organisms, including staphylococci, strep, colform molds, salmonella, yeast’s and clostridia. They also spread parasites that cause toxoplasmosis, an illness that can causes birth defects if the pregnant women gets infected.\n\nCockroaches spread disease by carrying contaminated organisms onto your countertop or onto your leftout food. Roaches will eat animal and human feces, rotten and contaminated food, book bindings, leather, and even the\n\nglue on canned food labels. They like the glue in paper bags and can be transported from grocery store to homes via the bags.\n\nThere are 4 types of cockroaches. The German Cockroach; the most common and the smallest of the species. American Cockroach; light brown with yellowish wings, can’t really fly, but glides. Oriental Cockroach; dark reddish brown. Brown Banded Cockroach; yellowish or brown with brown bands on wings. Cockroaches can grow to be 2 inches long.\n\nAs for reproduction, all cockroaches produce offspring the same way. The females produce 20 to 30 egg capsules per cycle, each containing between 15 and 40 eggs. Females can have up to 30,000 offspring in their lifetime.\n\nCockroaches like dark, moist, warm places to live in. The kitchen and bathroom fit this description but so do other places like laundry baskets. They will also live in boxes, paperbags and books. It is easy to transport them from house to house and even across oceans.\n\nPrevention and control are important in the fight to eliminate cockroaches. Killing only the ones you see is not effective, because if you see one there is 300 in hiding. To eliminate them in your house you have to get rid of their food and water, eliminate the present population with a poison and prevent future cockroaches from invading your house.\n\nAlways plug drains on sinks when not in use. Cockroaches can’t swim but they can come in through sewer pipes if the water has subsided. Keep counters, floors and cupboard free from food and crumbs.\n\nInsecticide sprays can be used to control cockroaches. You can call out a professional and pay for the service to your home. You can also spray yourself with an insecticide you buy at a home center. You have to make sure you get all the hiding places, cracks, crevices, baseboards and under\n\nsinks. you can also place boric acid powder along the same places and then when a cockroach walks through it, it clings to their feet and antennae. When they ingest the powder it kills them. Boric acid is fairly safe to use and\n\nhandle. Ingested in large quantities can make a human sick too. Cockroach bait houses are also effective as a supplement to spraying.\n\nYou must prevent cockroaches from entering your house by sealing up any holes and cracks along baseboards, door frames and windows. Seal up the space around water and sewer pipes, and electrical and telephone lines where they come inside. Keep all piles of debris and mulches and compost piles away from your house. Spray the perimeter of your house frequently. Cockroaches are stow aways and will come into your house in boxes, bags, pet food cartons (cockroaches love dog food), appliances and laundry, so inspect them carefully.", "doctor_answer": "It is believed that the cockroach may be a reservoir for a range of bacteria including salmonella, staphylococcus and streptococcus. The cockroach can also harbour viruses such as the polio virus."}

{"question": "I might have a broken tailbone what should i do?", "patient_answer": "You really need to get a x-ray to see if it is broken or just bruised.  An injured tailbone needs time to heal. A bruised tailbone may take several days to several weeks to completely heal. A fractured tailbone takes 4 to 6 weeks to heal. In either case, people sometimes have pain for a long time. \nWhile your tailbone injury is healing it is very important to use a doughnut cushion when you are sitting. A doughnut cushion may be purchased at a medical supply house or you may use a child's swimming inner tube. \nYou should place an ice pack on your tailbone for 20 to 30 minutes every 3 to 4 hours for 2 to 3 days or until the pain goes away. Your health care provider may prescribe an anti-inflammatory or pain medicines. \nIt is important to avoid constipation while your tailbone is healing.

{"question": "Help! Need big time reliable answers for bacterial infection that doesn't go away! Definately a system wide", "patient_answer": "Sounds like you are motivated to find out what is wrong that is causing this problem. A doctor is always the best source of information for health issues.\n\nPerhaps you should do some research, then go see a doctor.  If you are going in circles with the one you are going to, then maybe you should speak to a different one. You can still keep going to the same doctor you are now. You do not have to switch doctors; you are just getting an additional opinion.\n\nHopefully you are in a country where you can see a gynocologist. If you are, and they are not helping, maybe you should see a general practitioner, mention all the symptoms you are having and any other things you might have going on now.  Maybe they can point you to a different type of specialist.\n\nIf you have a bacterial infection, and they are certain it is one, it seems odd they have not identified which one it is. I am certainly no doctor but it seems like they could do a bacteria culture of it in less than 7 months.  Once it is identified, doctors frequently follow up by prescribing a course of antibiotics.\n\nViruses generally do not respond to antibiotics but lots of types of bacteria do. The antibiotic must be matched to the particular bacteria though.\n\nAlso, in addition to different species of bacteria, there are different strains of each species.  They can reproduce quickly, have very short lifespans, and  then die. This produces many generations in a much shorter time than humans - a lot faster that 20 years or so.\n\nWhat this means is they can evolve quickly.  They can actually therefore adapt to certain medicines and develop resistence.  This is a very simplified form of evolution, which is a very real phenomenon. I am not saying that you have a strain that is resistant to a particular medicine.  I am just pointing out it happens that some strains have evolved a little immunity to some medicines that normally work on other members of their species.\n\nWith antibiotics, it is important to stick to the particular medicine your doctor has prescribed for you.  You want to take it at the prescribed times/frequencies. Do not forget to take it or just stop taking it because you do not think it is working.  If for some reason you cannot take it because for example, it is making you incredibly ill - let your doctor know right away, so they can figure out what to do right then.  They might want to switch you to a different drug right then, or need you to stay on it. If an antibiotic has made you really sick, remember its name (write it down) so you can tell a doctor the next time you see one and he asks if you are allergic or have had any problems from any particular medication.\n\nI am including some links to common conditions that occur in that area.\n\nThe first few links are for yeast infections.  They are pretty common.  Not in the sense that you will get them all the time but in the sense that most women have it at least once in their lifetime. That kind of common. It is something that just sort of pops up under the right conditions, according to the web pages I found about it.  You can read how/why and so forth on them. Normally, it is not something people get because they caught it from someone else. In other words, they are not an STD.  Yeast is all around us in the environment.  It cannot infect someone unless conditions are just the right conditions for it to grow.  Otherwise, well it would be like a pumpkin growing in the Saharah desert.  Probably not going to happen, right?\n\nThere are STDs around that people can catch from other people.  Some are pretty common. You said you do not have one, which is good.  A lot of people do have them.  A lot of people are spreading them. \n\nInfection rates vary per country and go up and down. Health care officials keep track of the count of people that have certain types so they know when to take measures to get those numbers down again. Things like making public service announcements, putting out bulletins to phy", "doctor_answer": "A few tablespoons of Baking Soda mixed with a cup warm water may make a great douche. Works great when I smell a little ripe under the arms after working out, or not having a shower for awhile.

Whole Foods or Wild Oats may have something.\n\nPerhaps a second medical opinion from an experienced gyno?"}
{"question": "Does anyone have cyclothmania?", "patient_answer": "It is my understanding that Cyclothymia is a version of Bipolar that is characterized by milder and more frequent mood swings.

{"question": "how bad is it to crack your fingers? repeatedly? for years?", "patient_answer": "Cracking knuckles is the practice of manipulating one's fingers such that the hand (most usually the knuckle joint) produces a sharp sound, likened to cracking (also likened to popping, etc). To produce the sounds, many people will bend their fingers into unusual positions, or manipulate them in ways which are not commonly experienced in everyday use. For example, bending the fingers right back towards the back of the hand, or pulling them away from the hand.\n\nIn many early motion pictures and subsequently parodied in animated cartoons, the gesture of cracking knuckles was associated with a \"tough guy\" image, especially when accompanied by the implicit or explicit threat of violence.\n\nThe physical mechanism is unknown, but possibilities that have been suggested include:\n\n   1. cavitation within the joint - small cavities of partial vacuum form in the fluid then rapidly collapse, producing a sharp sound (hypothesis in a medical journal)\n   2. the sudden stretching of ligaments (hypothesis by one reader of that journal)\n   3. release of gas from the joints being adjusted (this applies to the popping that can occur in any joint such as during chiropractic manipulation)\n\nA single event is not enough to cause damage to the joint, although it is possible that prolonged joint stress due to cracking knuckles may eventually lead to a higher risk of joint damage. The long-term consequences of this practice have not been studied thoroughly, and the scientific evidence is inconclusive. However, the common parental advice \"Cracking your knuckles gives you arthritis\" may be simply a device to deter children from this practice, which many people find annoying because of the sound it makes. In actual fact, study by Castellanos and Axelrod showed that arthritis was not a product of knuckle cracking. They evaluated 300 consecutive outpatients at Mount Carmel Mercy Hospital to determine whether habitual knuckle cracking is a risk factor for hand dysfunction. They found no relation with osteoarthritis, but noted that 'knuckle crackers were more likely to have hand swelling and lower grip strength'\n\nA chiropractic perspective:\n\n    \"As a joint is being distracted, the capsule invaginates inward and as the stress on the capsule reaches a certain threshold, it suddenly snaps back from the synovial fluid, increasing the volume of the capsule (and decreasing pressure) and causing the audible sound. The sudden increase in the volume causes the tension to drop, allowing the joint to increase in movement. Eventually, the elastic limit of the capsule is reached and the process stops. The time elapsed during all this is shorter than that required for completion of the stretch reflex, so it can occur without muscular resistance. The sudden jerk on the capsule and the other periarticular tissues is theorized to cause firing of the high-threshold mechanoreceptors.\"", "doctor_answer": "What's really happening when you \"crack\" your knuckles is that you are either pushing the joint back into or out of its normal position. Joints are the meeting points of two separate bones which are held together by connecting tissues and ligaments. A thick, clear lubricant (made mostly of carbon dioxide and some nitrogen) called synovial fluid is found between the bones. When you stretch or pull your finger to get that desired popping noise, you are causing the bones to pull apart. Pressure is reduced on the synovial fluid and bubbles form that quickly expand and then burst - which is why you get that noise\nSo no harm in cracking"}

As your pregnancy progresses, this distance should continue to increase. \nWe use the metric system in obstetrics, so the measurement in centimeters usually correlates with the number of weeks you’re pregnant after the 20th week of pregnancy. \nIn other words, a 25-centimeter measurement is expected of a woman who’s 25 weeks pregnant. Your doctor uses this measurement to monitor the growth of the baby. If this number slows down, he or she may suggest further testing.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nAngel"}
{"question": "I have Hepetitis C ... my HCV RNA QT level is 1,010,000 ... how serious is this?", "patient_answer": "If you know your quantitative HCV RNA (viral load) is greater than 1 million, then you must be in medical care, right?  There are a number of questions that you should ask your doctor to help you better understand your disease.  First, HCV viral loads are reported in different units - IU/mL or copies/mL.  You likely have a \"high\" HCV viral load (usually anything greater than 600,000 IU/mL is considered \"high\").  The viral load has NO correlation with the severity of disease.  You can have a high viral load and no liver damage or a low viral load and extensive liver damamage - it depends.  However, it may make the infection more difficult to treat.\n\nYou should ask your doctor about your HCV genotype (usually 1, 2, 3, or 4) and discuss a liver biopsy.  The liver biopsy (thin needle inserted into liver to collect small sample of liver tissue) is the only difinitive way to determine the extent of damage in the liver.  It will tell your doctor how much inflammation the virus is causing.  With long term inflammation (over years - usually 10-20 years) inflammation can cause fibrosis.  Extensive fibrosis can result in liver function decline.  Over time, cirrhosis (extensive fibrosis) can lead to serious complications requiring a liver transplant.\n\nGet your liver checked - usually a hepatologist is the best source of information as they are experts in the evaluation of liver disease.  There is treatment available and a large portion of individuals eradicate the HCV infection and reverse some liver damage.\n\nLifestyle changes can help your liver as well - stop smoking, avoid alcohol, eat healthy and exercise to lose weight if necessary.\n\nCheck out the following website for excellent information about HCV.", "doctor_answer": "that is pretty serious.  that tells you that you have a very active disease process going on .  your doctor should be all over this."}

{"question": "HOW DO YOU FIGURE YOUR TOTAL BODY FAT?", "patient_answer": "What Can I Do To Measure My Body Fat?\n\nThe truth is… there’s several ways to do this.\n\n• Underwater Weighing\n• Bio-Electrical Impedance Analysis\n• BIA Body Fat Scales and Hang Grip Tests\n• Infrared\n• Circumference & Anthropometric\n• Other More Complicated Methods\n• Skin fold Measurements like “The Pinch Test”\n\nThe simplest and cheapest method is the skin fold test. You can purchase a set of calipers for about $20 and do this test in the privacy of your own\nhome. The accuracy of this test is almost as accurate as the methods above and it costs you nothing.\n\nFor individuals in the 15-35% range it’s deemed as accurate. For lean individuals it is probably the most accurate and for people over 35% body fat, other methods are more accurate.\n\nWhat it all boils down to is this…\n\nRegardless of the accuracy of the test, it’s fast, it’s simple and it’s cheap. And the only reason you measure your body fat is to determine progress.\nA simple set of calipers will get the job done. And you can do it over and over for no cost.

{"question": "Whats the best way to heal from a buldging disc in the lower back?", "patient_answer": "Here are some suggestions, but it would be best to talk to your doctor first to see what he recommends.\nAvoid movements and positions that increase pain or numbness. \nLimit your activities, and try briefly resting your back if your pain is severe. Try taking short walks and doing light activities that do not cause pain. Then gradually start your regular activities. Even if you have severe pain, bed rest of more than a few days can cause the muscles in your back—as well as the rest of your body—to become weaker. \nUse ice or heat to relieve pain. Apply ice 3 times a day. Do not use ice for longer than 15 to 20 minutes at a time. Heat relieves pain for some people, but it should not be used too soon after an injury. Ask your health professional about using ice and heat to reduce your pain. \nTake nonprescription pain relievers to help reduce pain. Examples include aspirin (such as Bayer), acetaminophen (such as Tylenol), ibuprofen (such as Motrin), and naproxen sodium (such as Aleve).  Exercising may help speed your recovery, prevent reinjury to your back, and reduce the risk of disability from back pain. Other steps that will keep your back strong and healthy include losing weight if you are overweight, and quitting smoking if you smoke.", "doctor_answer": "laying on the bare floor helps.

{"question": "Is there any cure for celiac disease?", "patient_answer": "Diagnosis\n\nTests\nThe gold standard test for coeliac disease is still upper endoscopy with biopsy of the distal duodenum or jejunum. To avoid false negative results, the first endoscopy must be done while the patient is on a normal, gluten-containing diet or very shortly after going on a gluten-free diet. Sometimes the endoscopy is repeated after the patient has been on a gluten-free diet, in order to ensure that the bowel has healed. However, upper endoscopy always carries a risk of false negative results. This is because coeliac disease may or may not damage villi throughout the entire small intestine, and upper endoscopy only examines the upper part of the intestine. In a patient whose intestinal damage is located further down, the biopsy may come back negative. If the endoscopy is positive the diagnosis is confirmed, but if it is negative, the diagnosis is not necessarily excluded.\n\nSerology has been proposed as a screening measure, because the presence in the blood of IgA antibodies reactive against gluten and tissue transglutaminase is indicative of coeliac disease. Like the endoscopy, these tests are not accurate in patients who have been on a gluten-free diet for some time; they must be performed while the person is on a normal diet or within a relatively short time after eliminating gluten. A thorough workup includes four tests:\n\nAnti-tissue Transglutaminase Antibody (tTG), IgA. This test is sometimes used alone. If this test is positive it is highly likely that the patient has celiac disease. tTG test is not reliable in children before the age of 2. \nAnti-Gliadin Antibodies (AGA), IgG and IgA. These tests are often useful when testing young symptomatic children, but they are found in fewer coeliacs than Anti-tTG, and their presence does not automatically indicate coeliac disease because they are found in some other disorders. Some people have an IgA deficiency that causes a false negative test; due to this and other factors, the IgA test has a relatively high rate of false negatives. \nAnti-Endomysial Antibodies (EMA), IgA. This test is being replaced by the Anti-tTG test because both tests measure the autoantibodies that cause the tissue damage associated with coeliac disease. Many physicians still order this test. This test as tTG test is also not reliable in children before the age of 2. \nAnti-Reticulin Antibodies (ARA), IgA. Anti-ARA is not ordered as frequently as it once was, because it is less sensitive and less specific than the other tests. It is found in about 60% of people with coeliac disease and 25% of those with dermatitis herpetiformis. \nMany doctors will not consider positive blood tests as definitive proof of coeliac disease, but will still require biopsy confirmation. A growing minority consider coeliac disease to be diagnosed where the patient has positive blood tests and shows improved symptoms after the adoption of a gluten-free diet. Because upper endoscopies are uncomfortable, expensive, and may produce false negative results, this group of doctors considers serology tests and a positive response to eliminating gluten from the diet to be sufficient for diagnosis. A small minority of doctors advocate gluten-free diets even for symptom-free patients who have not had an endoscopy but have had a positive blood test, because some confirmed coeliacs are completely symptom-free throughout their lives; in symptom-free patients, the purpose of the diet is to avoid nutritional deficiencies, osteoporosis, and intestinal lymphoma.\n\nOther tests that may assist in the diagnosis are a full blood count, electrolytes, renal function and liver enzymes. Coagulation testing may be useful to identify deficiency of vitamin K, which predisposes patients to hemorrhage.", "doctor_answer": "the only cure is to go on a gluten-free diet.  then the health risks all return to normal, your body will heal and your symptoms will go away.  it may sound hard at first, but for me, going gluten-free was like having my life handed back to me.  go to celiac.com and find out what foods/ingredients are forbidden and get started!  it is SO worth it to not feel sick, to have energy, and to be able to eat w/o pain and misery!! best of luck to you."}
{"question": "Why do my eyes get dry every night at 10 pm?", "patient_answer": "Well, if you use your vision for precision necessary excercises like reading or looking carefully at computer screens, pictures, etc etc, they will get dry.  If you do nothing and they still do, then you need to use drops.  Just the ones that are similar to natural tear drops.  Even the ones for people who wear contacts work well.  It doesnt matter if you wear contacts or not.  But, on the flip side, you might need to see a doctor beacause the tear ducts might be a bit small on your eyes so its a bit difficult to get moisture.  What they do is shoot a laser right at the tear duct to open it up a bit.  This is done almost painlessly.  Its a slight burn for about an hour or two.  At most it would be there till the next morning.  But, without this procedure, you might go blind early because there was not enough lubrication to protect your eyes and eyesight till your ripe age.  So ask your doctor.  In the mean time, those eye drops will work well.

Some types of treatment are: topical skin medication, limited sunlight exposure, steroids, exposure to ultraviolet light and oral medication.", "doctor_answer": "What is psoriasis?\nPsoriasis is a chronic skin condition characterized by inflamed, red, raised areas that often develop as silvery scales on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. Psoriasis affects nearly 6 million people in the US.\n\nWhat causes psoriasis?\nThe cause of psoriasis is unknown, however, it is thought to be caused by abnormally fast-growing and shedding skin cells. The skin cells multiply so quickly, causing the skin to shed every 3 to 4 days. Though not contagious, the condition is hereditary. Psoriasis is often recurrent and occurs in varying severities.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of psoriasis?\nThe following are the most common symptoms of psoriasis. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently, as psoriasis comes in several forms and severities. Symptoms may include: \n\ndiscoid psoriasis\nAlso called plaque psoriasis, this type of psoriasis is the most common. Symptoms may include patches of red, raised skin on the trunk, arms, legs, knees, elbows, genitals, and scalp. Nails may also thicken, become pitted, and separate from the nail beds. \nguttate psoriasis\nThis type of psoriasis affects mostly children. Symptoms may include many small patches of red, raised skin. A sore throat usually proceeds the onset of this type of psoriasis. \npustular psoriasis\nSymptoms may include small pustules (pus-containing blisters) all over the body or just on the palms, soles, and other small areas. \nThe symptoms of psoriasis may resemble other dermatologic conditions. Consult a physician for diagnosis.\n\nHow is psoriasis diagnosed?\nWhen the condition progresses to the development of silvery scales, the physician can usually diagnose psoriasis with a medical examination of the nails and skin. Confirmation of diagnosis may be done with a skin biopsy -- taking a small skin specimen to examine under a microscope.\n\nTreatment for psoriasis:\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation and slow down the rapid growth and shedding of skin cells. At the present time, there is no cure for psoriasis. Specific treatment for psoriasis will be determined by your physician based on: \n\nyour overall health, age, and medical history \nseverity of the condition \nyour tolerance of specific medications, procedures, or therapies \nyour opinion or preference \nTreatment may include one, or a combination, of the following: \n\nointments and creams to moisturize the skin \nsunlight or ultraviolet light exposure (under a physician's supervision) \nsteroids such as cortisone creams \nvitamin D cream \ncreams containing salicylic acid or coal tar \nAnthralin (a drug that treats the thicker, hard-to-treat patches of psoriasis) \nmethotrexate (an anti-cancer drug that interrupts the growth of skin cells)"}

{"question": "What is douching? How to do it safely?", "patient_answer": "Douching is rinsing or cleaning out the vagina (also called the birth canal) by squirting water or other solutions (such as vinegar, baking soda, or douching solutions you can buy at drug and grocery stores) into the vagina. The water or solutions are held in a bottle and squirted into the vagina through tubing and a nozzle.\n\nIs douching safe?\n\nHealth care providers do not recommend douching to clean the vagina. Douching changes the delicate chemical balance in the vagina (and the vaginal flora), which can make a woman more prone to bacterial infections. It also can spread existing vaginal or cervical infections up into the pelvic organs (uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries).\n\nResearch shows that women who douche on a routine basis tend to have more problems than women who do not douche or who rarely douche. These problems include vaginal irritation, infections (called bacterial vaginosis or BV), and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Women who douche often are also more at risk for getting pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of a woman's pelvic organs. It is caused by bacteria, which can travel from a woman's vagina and cervix up into her pelvic organs. If left untreated, PID can lead to infertility (not being able to get pregnant) and ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus). Both BV and PID can lead to serious problems during pregnancy, such as infection in the baby, problems with labor, and early delivery.", "doctor_answer": "I LOVE  MRS.

And it's probably because I wasn't taking good enough care of it to keep it going like I was!\n\nThe two most important things you can do are (1) SLEEP, and (2) DRINK...a LOT.

{"question": "are chiropractors legitmate doctors?", "patient_answer": "ABSOLUTELY!  Chiropractors have to go through classes very similar to those of medical doctors.  There is less emphasis placed on pharmacology since chriopractors do not dispense drugs and rely on natural methods.  Some chiropractic schools require their students to have a Bachelors degree before admittance, some only require certain courses, this is the same for medical schools.  Chiropractors have to take board exams and be licensed in the state they would like to practice in.  It is wise to consult a chiropractor for any musculoskeletal conditions before your medical doctor (if your insurance allows it, some require a referral) as these conditions are our speciality.  In addition, since chiropractors deal with the nervous system which effects every single cell of our bodies, it is often times wise to consult a chiropractor regarding internal medicine conditions (yes, we are trained on those as well).  We will not cut out or apart any part of your anatomy (believe me, it WAS put there for a reason) and we will not give you any drugs that cause toxicity in your body and create horrible side effects so you need more drugs to cure the side effects of the first drug. (This is not to say that there is a time and a place for both drugs and surgery, unfortunately both are grossly overused).  \n\nAs in any profession, there are good chiropractors and bad ones.  Unfortunately the bad ones get more press.  There are many, many different types of chiropractic, some work well for certain people some don't.  Do your research before seeing a doctor, ask around, find out who others recommend and for what conditions they were treated.  If the first chiropractor you go to doesn't help, try another.  Each one is different.  There are many good ones out there and unfortunately some bad.  Good luck.

{"question": "how to overcome problems relating to memory in obsessive compulsive disorder?", "patient_answer": "Treatment for OCD can include psychological treatments and medications. Psychological treatment can improve symptoms, and this improvement is often maintained in the long term. \n\nCognitive behaviour therapy \nCognitive behaviour therapy aims to change patterns of thinking, beliefs and behaviours that may trigger anxiety and obsessive compulsive symptoms. This therapy uses education to promote control over symptoms. The education includes information that helps to expose myths about the causes of OCD. \n\nPart of the therapy involves gradually exposing the person to situations that trigger their obsessions and, at the same time, helping them to reduce their compulsions and avoidance behaviours. This process is gradual and usually begins with the less feared situations. The exposure tasks and prevention of compulsions are repeated daily and consistently until anxiety decreases. Over time, this allows the person to rebuild trust in their capacity to manage and function, even with anxiety.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy should be undertaken with a skilled, specialist mental health professional. Over-use of alcohol, drugs and some medications may interfere with the success of this type of treatment. \n\nAnxiety management techniques\nAnxiety management techniques can help a person to manage their own symptoms. Such techniques can include relaxation training, slow breathing techniques, meditation and hyperventilation control. These techniques require regular practice and are most effective if used together with a cognitive behavioural treatment program. \n\nPsychotherapy \nPsychotherapy with a psychologist may assist the person with OCD to deal with issues and problems that have been caused or exacerbated by the disorder. \n\nMedication\nSome medications, especially antidepressants that affect the serotonin system, have been found to reduce symptoms of OCD. This medication can only be prescribed by a medical practitioner. \n\nSide effects of antidepressants may include nausea, headaches, dry mouth, blurred vision, dizziness and feeling sleepy. These effects often decline after the first few weeks of treatment. If your side effects are severe or last for a long time, you should discuss this with your doctor. \n\nIt usually takes several weeks for medication to deliver any effects. When reducing or stopping medication, the dose should be reduced slowly under medical supervision.\n\nHospitalisation\nAssessment and treatment in hospital can be helpful for some people, particularly when they first begin treatment for OCD or when symptoms are severe. A stay in hospital may last from several days to a few weeks. \n\nSupport groups and education\nSupport groups allow people with OCD and their families to meet in comfort and safety, and give and receive support. The groups also provide the opportunity to learn more about the disorder and to develop social networks.", "doctor_answer": "Treating OCD is not an easy task. One of the most successful therapies involves placing a person in a situation that usually triggers his anxiety, but the patient is not allowed to engage in the compulsive behavior that is the typical response. The idea is that eventually the stress from not performing the compulsive behavior will lessen over time to the point where the person no longer feels compelled to do it.\n\nPrescription drugs have also proven successful in reducing a person's obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors; this approach will not necessarily resolve the problem entirely but will free a person to live a normal life while confronting the issues appropriately through therapy."}

{"question": "everything about chondromalacia?", "patient_answer": "Chondromalacia Patellae (also known as CMP, Patello-femoral Pain Syndrome, or Runner's Knee) is a degenerative condition of the cartilage surface of the back of the knee cap, or patella. It produces discomfort or dull pain around or behind the patella. It is common in young adults, especially soccer players, cyclists, rowers,tennis players and runners. The condition may result from acute injury to the patella or from chronic friction between the patella and the groove in the femur through which it passes during motion of the knee. CMP specifically refers to a knee that has been structurally damaged, while the more generic term Patello-femoral Syndrome refers to the earlier stages of the condition, where symptoms might still be fully reversible.\n\nYou can find more information about Chondromalacia at the link below.", "doctor_answer": "Chondromalacia Patella is often used by physicians as a catch-all term to describe anterior knee pain that results from patellar malalignment.

The body \"releases\" the blood, and then goes back to not having \"periods\" until there is again too much blood to hold.

You should visit an endocrinologist and have the doctor check your hormone levels to make sure that everything is normal. PCOS can be treated with medication and diet.

{"question": "What's the most effective way to lose weight?", "patient_answer": "Change your eating habits and your diet. Cut out all the junk foods, sodas and unhealthy snacks if you eat them. If you have a snack, make it a piece of fruit or yogurt, or jello. Make sure you have something for breakfast always, you could have  a salad with a piece of fruit or yogurt for lunch and then have dinner. Drink lots of water. Trim most of the fat off meats and remove the skin from poultry. Take your time when you eat so that your brain has time to signal when you are full. I'm not joking. If you eat in a hurry you are overeating and by the time you feel full you have actually eaten too much. If you don't walk a lot, go for a one half hour walk 3 times a week. In addition to walking, you can also exercise at home for 20 mins. several times a week, do this on the days you are not walking. The exercise does not have to be strenuous exercises (such as lifting weights), just firming and toning ones. Once you lose the weight you want to, don't go back to your old eating habits.

Routine scintigraphic evaluation in cases of medial tibial bone pain showed that 63% had abnormalities. A stress fracture was found in 46%. Only two patients had periostitis. None had ischemic medial compartment syndrome. Physical examination could not differentiate between cases with medial tibial bone pain secondary to stress fractures and those with scintigraphically normal tibias.

{"question": "how to fix lazy eye?", "patient_answer": "Yes, patching the good eye can often help the \"lazy\" eye to improve, but the issue is much broader than that.  \n\n\"Lazy\" eye is a generic term for a couple of different medical conditions called strabismus and amblyopia.  Strabismus is when the eye muscles do not work together perfectly, so one eye points in a different direction than the other, either part-time or full-time.  Our brain does NOT like to see two images at once - too confusing to process, so the brain often picks the eye with the better image and \"turns off\" the eye with the poorer image, thereby ignoring the nerve signals from the poorer eye.\n\nWhen the brain learns to ignore the image from one eye, the nerves do not develop properlay and the vision often gets worse in the poorer eye.  This is called amblyopia.  Amblyopia is a long lasting loss of the quality of vision in one eye, usually resulting from strabismus (above) or anisometropia.  Anisometropia is when one eye has a very different prescription than the other, so the brain never gets proper visual signal from the poorer eye.\n\nThe result of all of these conditions is a \"lazy\" eye, an eye that does not work as well as the other eye.  \n\nSadly, the later that the diagnosis of \"lazy\" eye occurs, the harder and less complete is the recovery.  If a lazy eye is detected and treated by age 4, most of the visual develop can be rehabilitated, and both eyes will probably see well.  If the lazy eye is detected around age 6-7, the worse eye can become better, but will probably never be as good as the better eye.  Some doctors think that after age 13-14, almost no improvement will ever come from any treatments, the nerve damage is probably permanant, and little improvement is ever expected.\n\nSo, it depends on the age of the patient.  Search online for other information under:\n\nStrabismus\nAmblyopia\nAnisometropia\nVision therapy\nOptometrist\n\nGood luck!", "doctor_answer": "Often, a patch will be used to cover the \"good\" eye, forcing the lazy one to compensate."}

{"question": "can having sex in the annus cause a person to infect HIV?", "patient_answer": "Yes sometimes, if  both of you come in contact with blood.  Also remember  you might rupture one of your organs. Cause internal bleeding perhaps.", "doctor_answer": "An@l, Vaginal and/or Oral Sex can cause a person to be infected with the HIV virus.  In addition you may be infected with a large number of other Sexually Transmitted Diseases.\n\nI have included information from a web page of the Center for Disease Control.\n\n\"Can I get HIV from anal sex?\n\nYes. In fact, unprotected (without a condom) anal sex (intercourse) is considered to be very risky behavior. It is possible for either sex partner to become infected with HIV during anal sex. HIV can be found in the blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, or vaginal fluid of a person infected with the virus. In general, the person receiving the semen is at greater risk of getting HIV because the lining of the rectum is thin and may allow the virus to enter the body during anal sex. However, a person who inserts his penis into an infected partner also is at risk because HIV can enter through the urethra (the opening at the tip of the penis) or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis.\n\nNot having (abstaining from) sex is the most effective way to avoid HIV. If people choose to have anal sex, they should use a latex condom. Most of the time, condoms work well. However, condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex. Thus, even with a condom, anal sex can be risky. A person should use generous amounts of water-based lubricant in addition to the condom to reduce the chances of the condom breaking.\""}
{"question": "Is a chiropractor a real doctor?", "patient_answer": "In order to be accepted into any chiropractic college, students must take the same pre-requisites as any future medical student.  This includes 1 year of math, english, physics, and 2 years of chemistry (all with accompanying lab classes).  Chiropractic students receive a very similar education as medical students, with emphasis on diagnosis of many different medical conditions, lab work (blood or urine analysis), and basic sciences (physiology, pathology, basic anatomy, and neuroanatomy).  In addition, chiropractic students receive over 100 hours in palpation and technique courses, much more thoroughly than any Physical therapist or even MD attempting to 'manipulate' the spine.  Over 100 hours are also dedicated to learning radiology - how to take x-ray and interpret them - again, much more thoroughly than any medical student (those that are not specializing in radiology, of course).  So, yes, chiropractors are real doctors, and can recognize many different medical conditions and refer out appropriately.  Several studies have also shown that chiropractors are superior in dealing with musculoskeletal conditions (ie - neck pain and back pain), as well as other complaints than many MDs may ignore or cannot do anything about.", "doctor_answer": "I believe you are correct.  While they are not MD's, they do earn doctorates and are entitled to refer to themselves as doctors.  And since most healthcare insurance plans provide benefits to their insured for chiropractic care, I think they can be considered healthcare providers at the very least."}

You have to brush and floss to really clean your teeth. Probably any electric toothbrush together with flossing once a day regularly is better than the best electric toothbrush alone.", "doctor_answer": "I didn't like oral-B, too rough. After 2 to 3 months it wore out my enamel and I had to go to a dentist. Cybersonic is very gentle and effective except that each of them I used went out of order after about a year. I currently use Sonicare and I'm satisfied."}
{"question": "Is their any medicine to relieve from asthma permanently? Or anything?", "patient_answer": "Please start by seeing a doctor.  If your family has good insurance (or Medicaid -- most states covers kids above the poverty level), I would start with an allergist or a pulmonologist.  If you lack insurance, there are often community clinics where you can go for treatment.\n\nAsthma is a chronic disease that isn't really cured but can often be very effectively controlled.  Poor control causes many issues (and you know that!) and can even be life threatening.\n\nHow is it managed?  The first step is to try and figure out what causes your asthma.  This can often be an allergy (although asthma can also be triggered by other things such as cold air and exercise).  Regardless of the trigger, a doctor will work with you to reduce that trigger.  (In the case of allergies, this can involve everything from covering the mattress if the allergy is to dust to nasal sprays to allergy shots to limiting your exposure to certain things).\n\nThe doctor may also prescribe a slower acting medicine to help reduce the frequency and severity of attacks.  This most often an inhaler but could also be a pill.  And this is important:  asthma seems to sort of feed on itself and treatment can help reduce the inflamation.  Also important is to understand that this will not stop an astma attack that you justt started having -- it takes days to have an impact.\n\nIn addition, a doctor may presecribe a fast acting inhaler (often called a rescue inhaler).  This is designed to be used to treat a current astma attack.\n\nSo the plan:  a) reduce the triggers that cause the asthma; b) longer term medication to help soothe the inflamation and reduce the severity/frequemcy; and c) a rescue inhaler when a and b fail.  If you find yourself using the rescue inhaler often, contact your doctor as the first two steps probably need refined.\n\nMake sense? Good luck!", "doctor_answer": "There is no cure for asthma, but there are many medications and treatments out there these days that can help.  If you feel what you are already doing is not helping, it is best to see your doctor to make up a plan that works for you."}

{"question": "WHAT IS THE BEST CURE FOR MIGRAINE'S?", "patient_answer": "Talk to your doctor about Imitrex.  It's available in pills, nasal spray, or self-injector.\n\nCodeine will also help with the symptoms. \n\nIf you don't want to go the prescription route, try using ginger root.  It's a natural anti-nausea agent, and will help stop a migraine in its tracks.  It wont make one BETTER, but it can stop it from getting worse.\n\nThe fastest way to administer is to buy ginger root powder (available in grocery stores in the spices aisle), and add a half-teaspoonful to your favorite tea.  If it's taste is a little too much for you, you can buy it in pill form at most vitamin/supplement stores.  (Also great for helping prevent motionsickness!)\n\nCaffeine sometimes works.\n\nIf the symptoms are particularly bad, I like a cold compress in a pitch dark room in an attempt to sleep it off.  If you room isn't dark enough, tape tinfoil on the inside of the windows to block light.  If you don't have a cold compress, point a small fan at your face.\n\nThe best thing you can do about migraines is learn what your triggers are.  Sometimes it's food (or food combinations), too much light, too much heat, too much exertion, etc.  But involving a doctor is always a good idea.\n\nIf you get a migraine, try to write down everything you did prior to it, hopefully you will be able to narrow down some of your triggers over time.\n\nBest of luck to ya.", "doctor_answer": "If you get a lot of migraines, I would talk to your doctor if you are getting two or more per week.  I get at least that many and though this seems to be a problem that affects mostly women (correct?), I'm a guy and I get them all the time, I'm told its genetic.

{"question": "How long can a person live with with the full blown aids virus, also can they fight off the flu, common colds?", "patient_answer": "We don't really use the term \"full blown AIDS\" anymore.

I have known people with less than 10 T-cells who have been relatively healthy for a few years.  There are medications that can prevent other types of infections that affect people with AIDS too.\n\nSo, how long can you live? No one really knows.  With medications, people with AIDS can live long and healthy lives.\n\nFor someone with a badly damaged immune system and not recieving medical care - a common cold or the flu can lead to other infections that eventually could kill the person.", "doctor_answer": "From full blown AIDS virus I assume some other infections are also present or showing there signs.\nNow with the help of antiviral drugs like ZUDOVIDINE viral load can be kept in control and quality of life is improved .

{"question": "what side effects can zonegran have on a unborn child?", "patient_answer": "The use of Zonegran (zonisamide) by pregnant women hasn't been fully studied, but there are serious concerns based on studies using animals. When it was given to pregnant mice, rats, and dogs early in pregnancy, there were high rates of fetal abnormalities, especially heart defects and skeletal malformations. After it was given to monkeys during certain stages of pregnancy, many of the fetuses died, possibly because of malformations. All of these effects occurred at doses (and blood levels in the mother) that were equivalent to the amounts used to treat epilepsy in humans, or sometimes even lower. There was also a higher rate of death among the offspring of rats who were given zonisamide late in their pregnancy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has labeled Zonegran as \"Pregnancy Category C\" and recommends that women who could possibly become pregnant should use effective birth control while using Zonegran. Recognizing that seizures in the mother also may be hazardous to a fetus, however, they conclude that the risks and benefits must be weighed in considering the use of Zonegran during pregnancy.

{"question": "Why is that when we sit in airconditioned place after exercising or sweating a bit, we feel sleepy?", "patient_answer": "People naturally sleep better in a cold room or when the body becomes suddenly cold. This is due to part of your circadian rhythm. In addition to sleep naturally being effected by light (your internal clock, the superchiasmatic nucleus, is located near the optic chiasm where the optic nerves cross); most humans will wake easier by the light of the sun and sleep easier in the dark, there is also sleep regulation based on body temperature. \n\nThe human core body temperature changes slightly throughout a day. At around 3 AM the body temperature is at its lowest. It starts to rise until near noon when it plateus and even dips a little bit (this results in people getting tired around lunch time...not because of the lunch itself, after all, you don't get tired after eating breakfast or dinner). Many populations, such as Mexico, take into account this normal fatigue and allow workers to nap (siesta) around that time. Afternoon the body starts rising in temperature again until around 8 PM when it begins to fall again overnight.", "doctor_answer": "When you exercise your body releases endorphins which make you feel good and relax you. If you sit down in a comfortable place and feel good and relaxed it is normal for you to feel a bit sleepy."}

{"question": "how to beat cancer?", "patient_answer": "Treatment of cancer\n\nCancer can be treated by surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy or other methods. The choice of therapy depends upon the location and grade of the tumor and the stage of the disease, as well as the general state of the patient (performance status). A number of experimental cancer treatments are also under development.\n\nComplete removal of the cancer without damage to the rest of the body is the goal of treatment. Sometimes this can be accomplished by surgery, but the propensity of cancers to invade adjacent tissue or to spread to distant sites by microscopic metastasis often limits its effectiveness. The effectiveness of chemotherapy is often limited by toxicity to other tissues in the body. Radiation can also cause damage to normal tissue.\n\nBecause \"cancer\" refers to a class of diseases, it is unlikely that there will ever be a single \"cure for cancer\" any more than there will be a single treatment for all infectious diseases.\n[edit]\n\nSurgery\n\nIf the tumor is localized, surgery is often the preferred treatment. Example procedures include mastectomy for breast cancer and prostatectomy for prostate cancer. The goal of the surgery can be either the removal of only the tumor, or the entire organ. Since a single cancer cell can grow into a sizable tumor, removing only the tumor leads to a greater chance of recurrence. A margin of healthy tissue is often resected to make sure all cancerous tissue is removed.\n\nIn addition to removal of the primary tumor, surgery is often necessary for staging, e.g. determining the extent of the disease and whether there has been metastasis to regional lymph nodes. Staging determines the prognosis and the need for adjuvant therapy.\n\nOccasionally, surgery is necessary to control symptoms, such as spinal cord compression or bowel obstruction. This is referred to as palliative treatment.\n[edit]\n\nChemotherapy\n\nChemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with drugs (\"anticancer drugs\") that can destroy cancer cells. It interferes with cell division in various possible ways, e.g. with the duplication of DNA or the separation of newly formed chromosomes. Most forms of chemotherapy target all rapidly dividing cells and are not specific for cancer cells. Hence, chemotherapy has the potential to harm healthy tissue, especially those tissues that have a high replacement rate (e.g. intestinal lining). These cells usually repair themselves after chemotherapy.\n\nBecause some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are often given at the same time. This is called \"combination chemotherapy\"; most chemotherapy regimens are given in a combination.\n\nA novel technique involves taking samples of the patient's tissue before chemotherapy. These tissues samples are screened to ensure they do not contain cancerous cells. The samples are expanded using tissue engineering techniques, and are then re-implanted following high dose chemotherapy in order to recolonise the damaged and somewhat destroyed tissue. A variation upon this method uses allogenic samples (samples donated by a different donor) instead of the patient's own tissue4.\n[edit]\n\nImmunotherapy\n\nImmunotherapy is the use of immune mechanisms against tumors. These are used in various forms of cancer, such as breast cancer (trastuzumab/Herceptin®) but also in leukemia (gemtuzumab ozogamicin/Mylotarg®). The agents are monoclonal antibodies directed against proteins that are characteristic to the cells of the cancer in question, or cytokines that modulate the immune system's response.\n[edit]\n\nRadiation therapy\n\nRadiation therapy (also called radiotherapy, X-ray therapy, or irradiation) is the use of ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation therapy can be administered externally via external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or internally via brachytherapy. The effects of radiation therapy are localised and confined to", "doctor_answer": "Chemo is no therapy.  It tries to kill the cancer before it kills you.  And if it can do this, then you are considered cured.  But, during the time that you have not been cured yet, the chemo destroys your body and deteriorates your health.  Chemo is just something that doctors do to take all the money you have left before you die.  How many people you know have lived more then 5 years after chemo?  Not too many if any at all.  And compared to the masses, its practically nobody.  The best thing for you to do is go to the websites that sell alternative medicines for cancer.  They have such medicines such as CESIUM CHLORIDE, GREEN ALGAE, OXYGEN DROPS, AND PAW PAW, etc etc.  They can cure like 90% of cancers even at their 2nd or 3rd stage.  Timing is critical in times like these.  You can call up some of the websites that only sell cancer medicines.  The medical community will not allow these people to sell medicine.  If they do then it would have to be sold as a health product or vitamins.  So, their labels cannot say anything about cancer.  But, their websites can tell you what it cures and how to use it.  This is how evil the medical people are.  They want to kill you and keep the rest of your money while doing it.  So, instead of going to their dead end route, just go to these websites and look up these medicines.  There are even places that give complete packages on certain cancers depending on what cancer you have, your age, and your health condition, etc etc.  Try looking up DSMO, or something of that sort.  Ask the people on the websites and they will tell you.  I wish you the best of luck my friend."}

{"question": "Which diet is good for ur good health, veg or non-veg?", "patient_answer": "In the defense of protein: Veggies increase your gas.[nothing against vegetarians]\n\nThe basics of most nutrition books\nDon’t starve yourself. That’s the worst thing you can do in a diet because it slows down your metabolism and your body starts getting more fat from your food intake since, fat is the bodies fastest and easiest type of nutrition[not the healthiest though]. The reason this happen is because this helped us when we were no doing so good as hunters and gathers to keep us alive a bit longer. \n\nBefore I continue let me explain protein, carbohydrates, and fats.\n\nProtein is easiest described as anything that comes from or was an animal such chicken, fish, sirloin, and milk. \n\nCarbohydrates [carbs] can be found almost in anything else even apples.\nGood carbs:\nApples, wheat bread, sourdough bread, grains, and wheat \nBad carbs:\nWhite bread, hamburger buns, hotdog buns, Doritos, and sodas!\n\nGood fats:\nAvocados, pecans, almonds, and peanut butter \n\nThe ratio in your diet varies but I think a good starting point is something like\n[50%Protien:40%Carbs:10%fat]\n\nThis can sound meaningless. So in plain terms consume only good fats [portioned] and you should be okay.  Something like a handful of almonds, or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [separately. not consecutively]. \n\nThe reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because you are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [Proteins are 4 calories, Carbs are 4 calories, Fats are 9 calories] so theoretically if you eat less fats and more proteins you will have a less appetite because you will eat more. \n\nAnother nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself. That’s how the Adkins basically works. If you consume more proteins and less carbs you will lose weight. I leave to you to decide if this is good you.\n\nI would also advice you to split up your day into 5 meals. [warning: it will feel weird because you are not used to eating this decreased amount. Just keep in mind that you will eat in 3 hour and you will quickly noticed that you will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry] if you do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla.\n\nYou are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [if you have been starving yourself or if you don’t exercise].", "doctor_answer": "veg (yum yum yum yum yum)"}

Often inherited from parental genes, this group of disorders is believed to be a result of an over-production of keratin, an important component to the outer layer of skin, nails and hair.  The most common inherited forms of Ichthyosis include Ichthyosis vulgaris, Lammelar ichthyosis, and X-linked ichthyosis. Acquired ichtyosis is associated with other systemic diseases, such as hypothyroidism, hepatitis, HIV infection, and some forms of cancer like Hodgkin's lymphoma or leukemia.  The term 'ichthyosis' is also sometimes used to describe milder dry skin disorders such as Xeroderma, which is neither inherited nor acquired and can result from something as simple as bathing too much.\n\nDiagnosis and treatment for ichthyosis is broad, since there are a variety of potential causes for ichthyosis.  Because of the largely genetic pathology of ichthyosis, there are only treatments that reduce symptoms and the pain and discomfort associated with scaled skin.  More severe forms of ichthyosis are treated with medications that block keratin formation, such as retinoids and imidazole derivatives."}

{"question": "are bruises and cancer highly correlated?", "patient_answer": "Well, its not related to cancer so dont worry.  My mother has the same thing.  It is because of not eating enough.  She can sometimes go on till 5 o clock with just half a bottle of water.  She has some deficiency in her blood.  But, then again, you can just bruise easily.  Each person is different.  Nothing happens to her except the fact that she bruises easily.  Ask your doctor carefully.", "doctor_answer": "Bruising easily can be symptomatic of several things that could be happening in your body. From very simple to not so simple. I would bring this up again at your appointment, not just the one you have but mention that you get several. I don't know how your  doctors are, some will not run any tests until pushed and pushed, (its all because of insurance) it may be a simple blood test can tell you that you have a vitamin need. I would not jump to conclusions but I would push for  answers, if this has been ongoing for awhile. Try to pay attention to what your body is telling you, are you having any other symptoms. Do you have unusual or different than normal food cravings? Do you sleep differently? Your body holds many clues you just need to listen to them. Take care !"}

{"question": "Ex-Smokers,How did you quit? Patches?Gum?Cold Turkey?What worked for you?", "patient_answer": "Cold turkey.  \n\nIt works, but only if you are 100% resolved in your mind.  You must be of the mind that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.  You must focus your EMOTIONAL energy; be angry with the addiction.  Be mad that you could be twisted and manipulated into this addiction to nicotine.  Remember the wet ragged cough, the trips to the store to buy cigs at inconvenient times, in bad weather, when you are low on money, etc.  Remember how you stink after smoking; how its smell sticks to your clothes, your car, home, etc.  Think about all those megatives and realize that for every cig that you enjoy, several others are not enjoyed but are consumed to satisfy your body's addiction.  \n\nCigarettes are physically addictive, comparable to cocaine or alcohol.  Nicotine is a powerful substance.\n\nDo it!  Don't look back- it's a good move!", "doctor_answer": "I quit 8 years ago and it was the BEST thing I have ever done for myself!  I used the Nicoderm patch.  If you decide to try it, I won't candy-coat this method and tell you \"its a breeze\"; its not. But as a heavy-heavy smoker of 20 years, I will tell you truthfully that quitting smoking takes, first and foremost, WILLPOWER.  Even though the nicotine in your system makes it a \"physical\" addiction, it is also a \"mental\" addiction as well.  You mentally have to stop associating smoking with things that are pleasurable; for me, it was smoking while doing artwork, smoking while out in clubs and having a drink (but smoking in clubs is getting more and more rare).  You will be cranky for about 2 weeks while on the patch and you should try and stay away from other people that smoke; just the smell of a cigarette being lit or even the SOUND of a Bic lighter being lit, was enough to make me want a cigarette!  Keep your hands busy, don't sit around because you will think about it.  Your teeth will look better and as a BIG incentive, your hair and your clothes will not reek of yesterday's smoke.  You will also not have to clean all that yellow-ish nicotine stain off your walls!  I would highly reocmmend the patch; cold turkey is so awful, the withdrawal without any help is just terrible and so unnecessary.  YOU CAN DO IT!  Good luck in whatever method you chose!"}

{"question": "What are some good preventive measures to keep from having cellulitis ( which is a very bad infection) ?", "patient_answer": "Protecting one's skin from cuts, scratches, blisters, splinters, animal bites, and insect bites can help prevent cellulitis.\n\nWhen one does get a cut or scrape, wounds should be washed thoroughly with soap and water. An antibiotic ointment can be applied to the wound, which should be covered with a bandage or gauze.\n\nFor larger cuts, deep punctures, or bites (animal or human), it is advisable to seek a doctor's help as soon as possible to prevent cellulitis. Preventive antibiotics for some types of wounds, such as deep puncture wounds of the hands, may be given.\n\nTo help prevent cellulitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae bacteria, children should be immunized with the Hib vaccine. To help prevent cellulitis as a complication of chicken pox, children should be immunized with the varicella vaccine.", "doctor_answer": "Some diseases such as hidradenitis suppurativa are very susceptible to cellulitis. It is extremely important to keep the area as clean and dry as possible. Soap and water, followed by either Betadine or Peroxide in the wound. Apply gauze over the wound ( I suggest the kind that does not stick). Make sure to get to the doctor ASAP and get started on antibiotics this is of the utmost importance.

{"question": "How long does nicotine from cigarettes stay in your system?", "patient_answer": "Most experiments on humans tend to find the elimination half-life of nicotine to be between 9 and 12 hours.

Some of the metabolites have elimination half-lives of up to 20 or even 24 hours.", "doctor_answer": "not very long. smokers are actually always in withdrawl it just depends on how much you are used to."}
{"question": "What is avian flu and why is everyone so worried about it?", "patient_answer": "Avian flu is a serious virus that can be dangerous to the elderly, the young, and anyone with compromised immune systems.  While it is mostly still contained to birds, it is spreading rapidly and there have been reports of it spreading to humans.\n\nExcerpts from the CDC:\nBird flu is an infection caused by avian (bird) influenza (flu) viruses. These flu viruses occur naturally among birds. Wild birds worldwide carry the viruses in their intestines, but usually do not get sick from them. However, bird flu is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds, including chickens, ducks, and turkeys, very sick and kill them.\n\nBird flu viruses do not usually infect humans, but several cases of human infection with bird flu viruses have occurred since 1997.\n\nThe current outbreak of avian influenza A (H5N1) among poultry in Asia and Europe (see below) is an example of a bird flu outbreak that has caused human infections and deaths. In such situations, people should avoid contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces, and should be careful when handling and cooking poultry. For more information about avian influenza and food safety issues, visit the the World Health Organization website\n\nSymptoms of bird flu in humans have ranged from typical flu-like symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat and muscle aches) to eye infections, pneumonia, severe respiratory diseases (such as acute respiratory distress), and other severe and life-threatening complications. The symptoms of bird flu may depend on which virus caused the infection.", "doctor_answer": "See also http://qa.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=1005110400014\n\nThe 1918, 1957 and and 1968 flu pandemics can be traced back to bird flu mutating with human virus. These pandemics killed scores of people. The panic also stems from the fact that there is no vaccine for H5N1 virus, the bird flu that is currently affecting Asia. Like last year, vaccines for \"regular\" human flu are in short supply as well.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, when the flu hits you re just feverish, achey and fatigued for a few days. When the flu strikes more vulnerable people, like the elderly and very young babies, it can cause respiratory problems and even kill them."}

{"question": "what are the long terms effect of consuming marijuana everyday? Does it have any high BP (hypertension) link?", "patient_answer": "There is some evidence from human studies that long-term marijuana use\ncan have adverse effects, although it seems that the spectrum of these\neffects is narrower than previously thought and mainly centres around\ncognitive (intellectual) function.\n\nA paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) vol.\n287 No. 9, March 6, 2002, pp. 1123-1131) found that long-term cannabis\nusers performed less well than shorter-term users and controls (people\nwho didn’t use cannabis) in tests of memory and attention.  The\nlong-term users averaged 23.9 years of use, compared with 10.2 years\nin the shorter-term users. You can find an abstract at the American\nMedical Association web site: \nhttp://jama.ama-assn.org/issues/v287n9/abs/joc11416.html , but access\nto the full text requires subscription to the journal.  Note that the\ncomments associated with the article (links to them are underneath the\nabstract) indicate that some other investigators do not agree with\nthis conclusion.\n\nAnother study published in a Canadian medical journal (CMAJ 2002 Apr\n2;166(7):887-91 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11949984&dopt=Abstract)\nfound that: “Current marijuana use had a negative effect on global IQ\nscore only in subjects who smoked 5 or more joints per week. A\nnegative effect was not observed among subjects who had previously\nbeen heavy users but were no longer using the substance. We conclude\nthat marijuana does not have a long-term negative impact on global\nintelligence.”  This study compared IQ scores of individuals aged 9-12\nyears before they started using cannabis, with their scores at 17-20\nyears.  Light users, former users and non-users showed a gain in IQ\nover the same period.\n\nOne reason for the decreased IQ and memory in consistent heavy users\ncould be the fact that long-term cannabis use has been found to\ndecrease blood flow to the front areas of the brain (Neurotoxicology\nand Teratology 2001 Sep-Oct; vol 23 pp. 437-43  Frontal lobe\ndysfunction in long-term cannabis users by  Lundqvist T, Jonsson S,\nWarkentin S. of the Division of Medical Neurochemistry, Lund\nUniversity Hospital, 221 85, Lund, Sweden  \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11711246&dopt=Abstract\n\nA study published in Public Health and Nutrition, June 2001, vol. 4\npp. 781-786 (Dietary intake and nutritional status of US adult\nmarijuana users: results from the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey.

The authors concluded this was associated with different\ndietary habits: “We found higher cigarette-smoking rates and higher\nconsumption of sodas and alcohol, specifically beer, among marijuana\nusers than among non-current marijuana users. Marijuana users also\nconsumed more sodium, fewer fruits, and more pork, cheese, and salty\nsnacks.”  Carotenoids are important anti-oxidants which help to\nprevent cancer and other diseases.  An increased risk of these\ndiseases might be due not so much to marijuana use itself as to the\nlifestyle led by many who use it.  Better attention to nutrition, in\norder to ensure a good intake of fresh fruit and vegetables,\nparticularly the red, yellow and orange ones, will help to boost\nantioxidant status (see below)\n\nA review of various studies came to the conclusion that: “Regular\nmarijuana use can lead to extensive airway injury and alterations in\nthe structure and function of alveolar macrophages, potentially\npredisposing to pulmonary infection and respiratory cancer.”  Alveolar\nmacrophages are cells in the lungs that help clear away debris and\nba", "doctor_answer": "memory-loss"}
{"question": "what is a bone island?", "patient_answer": "A bone island, also known as an enostosis, is a focus of compact bone located in cancellous bone. This is a benign entity that is usually found incidentally on imaging studies; however, the bone island may mimic a more sinister process, such as an osteoblastic metastasis (eg, from prostate cancer).\n\n\nPathophysiology: Although the exact etiology of bone islands is not clear, they are almost certainly developmental in nature, likely representing cortical bone that has failed to undergo medullary resorption during the process of endochondral ossification. Histologically, bone islands are intramedullary foci of normal compact bone with haversian canals and \"thorny\" radiations that merge with the trabeculae of surrounding normal cancellous bone.", "doctor_answer": "when there is a bone surrounded by other type of tissue like cartilage, etc"}

{"question": "completely occluded artery on left side how dangerous is that?", "patient_answer": "The coronary arteries surround the heart to  supply the heart muscle with the fresh blood nourishment it needs to do its work of pumping blood throughout the rest of the body. Just like other organs, the heart needs a constant supply of oxygenated blood to feed itself. Coronary Artery Disease is an occlusion (obstruction) of the coronary (heart) arteries resulting from atherosclerosis (arteriosclerosis). When the body goes into more strenuous activity, the heart has to work harder to supply the body's demands for fresh, oxygen-rich blood. \n\n\nAn ischemic heart reacts by giving off a sensation of pain. We call this pain angina, or, more technically, angina pectoris. When the blockage of an artery is complete, for example, when an occluded artery is blocked by a thrombus (blood clot), the result is a heart attack. The heart tissue supplied by that coronary artery begins to die, and some of the heart muscle may be permanently damaged, or, in very severe cases, may result in death of the patient.\n\nOn a personal note - My father had a triple heart by-pass last year as he had 3 blocked ones, he has been told that he can and should now lead a normal life and that his heart will not be the reason he dies as its beating now as though he was 20 years younger.", "doctor_answer": "my husband has an complete occured artery (carotide)by left size ; so he's now right size paralysed,don't speak, don't read, don't write.\nand he's ony 46 years old.\nso, be carefully with this kind of disease!"}

Something like a handful of almonds, or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [separately. not consecutively]. \n\nThe reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because you are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [Proteins are 4 calories, Carbs are 4 calories, Fats are 9 calories] so theoretically if you eat less fats and more proteins you will have a less appetite because you will eat more. \n\nAnother nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself. That’s how the Adkins basically works. If you consume more proteins and less carbs you will lose weight. I leave to you to decide if this is good you.\n\nI would also advice you to split up your day into 5 meals. [warning: it will feel weird because you are not used to eating this decreased amount. Just keep in mind that you will eat in 3 hour and you will quickly noticed that you will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry] if you do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla.\n\nYou are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [if you have been starving yourself or if you don’t exercise].", "doctor_answer": "Try to eat healthy food and exercise. Sounds simple!"}

{"question": "how do finger nails grow?", "patient_answer": "they grow like our body.", "doctor_answer": "They grow from the \"root\" of the nail, i.e. the part of the nail that \"inserts\" into the skin of your finger or toe. New nail grows there and pushes out the older cells.\n\nIn fact if you lose a nail it will grow from inside out. Removing the root of the nail, which actually is completely covered by the skin, or part of it, will prevent the nail to grow or limit its breadth."}
{"question": "Do humidifiers help dry skin?", "patient_answer": "it should....make sure the humidifier is enough for the house you are trying to operate in.", "doctor_answer": "The short answer is yes. A humidifier isn't going to moisturize your skin, but it'll help prevent your skin from getting dryer by pumping some moisture back in the air. Anytime you have heat in your home, it's going to deprive the air of moisture. A humidifer helps to put that back in so that your skin isn't as parched, and you don't wake up feeling really thirsty and dried out.\n\nBut if your skin is peely and flaky, then you'll need to supplement the effects of a humidifier with a good moisturizer. During the winter, the dry, cold outdoors plus the intense heat indoors can really do a number on skin! It's also important to stay well-hydrated if you have dry skin."}

Through this, they can pinpoint what kind of  anormalities there are:-)", "doctor_answer": "There is no way to know when you are pregnant if your child will be born with, or later develop some form of autism spectrum disorder.   Most cases of autism are idiopathic, which means we don't know exactly what caused it.  Some of the prenatal tests that may be done can help to determine whether or not your child may have certain genetic, physical or metabolic disorders, but these tests are not 100% accurate and some of the more invasive tests carry their own risk % for the developing baby.  \n\nIf you have family members with autism spectrum disorders then your child may have a slightly higher risk than the general population for developing autism at some point in early childhood.  Some genetic disorders have autistic symptoms as part of their expression and these genetic disorders can be tested for if your family history suggests those traits are present.  \n\nThe best thing you can do for your child is to do your best to have a healthy pregnancy and to ensure that you have good regular prenatal care."}

Ribavirin may be used in people older than age 3 to treat hepatitis C. \nThe most effective treatment for HIV is highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)—a combination of several antiretroviral drugs that aims to control the amount of virus in your body. Other steps you can take include keeping your immune system strong, taking drugs as prescribed, and monitoring your CD4+ (white blood cells) counts to slow the multiplication of the virus in your body.\nHAART drugs that are most often used to treat HIV infection include:\nNucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), also called nucleoside analogs, such as zidovudine (ZDV, formerly AZT) and stavudine (d4T). These drugs are often combined with other drugs for best results. \nNonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), such as efavirenz, nevirapine, or delavirdine. \nNucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as tenofovir. \nProtease inhibitors (PIs), such as atazanavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, fosamprenavir, or lopinavir/ritonavir. \nFusion inhibitors, such as enfuvirtide.

{"question": "What is the difference between a cold and allergies?", "patient_answer": "The common cold and alergies are two completely different conditions; although, they may produce similar symptoms in your body.\n\nThe common cold (also known as \"acute nasopharyngitis\") is a mild viral infectious disease of the nose and throat; the upper respiratory system. Symptoms include sneezing, sniffling, running/blocked nose (often these occur simultaneously, or one in each nostril); scratchy, sore, or phlegmy throat; coughing; headache; and tiredness. Colds typically last three to five days, with residual coughing lasting up to three weeks. \n\nAn allergy or Type I hypersensitivity is an immune malfunction whereby a person's body is hypersensitised to react immunologically to typically nonimmunogenic substances. When a person is hypersensitised, these substances are known as allergens. The word allergy derives from the Greek words allos meaning \"other\" and ergon meaning \"reaction\" or \"reactivity\". Type I hypersensitivity is characterised by excessive activation of mast cells by immunoglobulin E resulting in a systemic inflammatory response that can result in symptoms as benign as a runny nose, to life-threatening anaphylactic shock and death.", "doctor_answer": "The difference between cold and allergies is simple. A cold is caused by a virus, usually a rhinovirus, to be specific. The virus causes an immune reaction which is what makes you feel those symptoms, i.e. a fever, stuffy nose, etc.\n\nAn allergy is produced by the body. It is essentially the body's immune system over-reacting to what is an innocuos substance- i.e. peanut butter, shell fish, or pollen from plants."}

Some hepatologists consider this a \"cure\" while others are hesitant to use that word.  Once treatment is completed, you typically have an HCV viral load test 6 months after completing therapy.  If there is no detectable virus, then you have achieved a sustained viral response or SVR.  This is very indicative of long term clearance of the virus.  HCV antibodies can still be detectable, even after the virus has been cleared.  A standard HCV antibody screening test would still be positive and life insurance companies may still consider you infected as a result of positive antibody tests.  However, the long term risk of fibrosis and cirrhosis are dramatically reduced if not eliminated.  \n\nThere are reports of sexual transmission of HCV, but it is a very low liklihood.  In fact, the CDC does not make any specific recommendations regarding safe sex between partners with different HCV status.\n\nFrom CDC website: \"If you have one long-term, steady sex partner, there is a very low chance of giving HCV to that partner and you do not need to change your sexual practices. If you want to lower the small chance of spreading HCV to your sex partner, you may decide to use latex condoms. (The efficacy of latex condoms in preventing infection with HCV is unknown, but their proper use may reduce transmission.) Ask your doctor about having your sex partner tested.\"", "doctor_answer": "first of all HCV is cured now in over 50% of cases by modern therapy.  Some of your readers obviously are not very educated.  Secondly, HCV is probably never transmitted by kissing and rarely if ever transmitted sexually.  Indeed, if you check the CDC (center for disease control) website it recommends no special precautions for sexual contact amongst monogamous couples even if HCV test is positive.  I feel that HCV probably is transmitted RARELY via sexual transmission, but on the order of 1% of the time.  Hep B on the other hand is commonly transmitted sexually.  You can only consider yourself cured if you tested negative six months after your therapy has ended.\n\nMrfrndly would do well to stay out of the health field questions particularly with regards to hepatitis---obviously not very knowledable in this field"}

{"question": "why are women only allowed 3 c-section?", "patient_answer": "uterine rupture is a serious risk of VBAC..vaginal birth after ceserian....however...the continuance of c-sections also cause a risk of uterine rupture. Because, no matter how many you have, they (the MD) keep cutting in the same area. That area beomes more and more weak with each surgery. There is no magic number of how many sections one can have, but, there are risks as well. And as for VBAC's...they are less of a risk than a section. Yes, there is the risk of uterine rupture, but, major surgery carries its own risks. Infection, longer recovery time, etc....and the uterine rupture risk is low. Just my 2 cents as a maternity nurse..", "doctor_answer": "That's ridiculous. Women can have as many c-sections as is healthy for them. In fact, there is significant evidence that once you have had a c-section, it is preferable to have subsequent babies by Caesarean, because of the risk of uterine rupture."}

Oseltamivir blocks the action of neuraminidase (it is a neuraminidase inhibitor) thereby reducing the spread of influenza. By preventing the spread of virus from cell to cell, the symptoms and duration of influenza infection are reduced. On average, oseltamivir reduces the duration of symptoms by one and a half days if treatment is started within forty-eight hours after symptoms begin. \n\nGeneric Available: No \n\nPrescription: Yes \n\nPreparations: 75 mg tablets \n\nStorage: Store at room temperature, 15-30°C (59-86°F) \n\nPrescribed For: Oseltamivir is used for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza infection in adults who have had symptoms for no longer than two days. \n\nDosing: Oseltamivir is administered orally. The recommended dose is one tablet twice daily for five days. For the best results, treatment should begin as soon as symptoms develop. \n\nDrug Interactions: There are no known interactions between oseltamivir and other drugs. Oseltamivir does not interact with the flu vaccine. Therefore, vaccinated individuals can use oseltamivir and vice versa.. \n\nPregnancy: Oseltamivir has not been adequately evaluated in pregnant women. \n\nNursing Mothers: The use of oseltamivir in nursing mothers has not been evaluated. \n\nSide Effects: The most frequent side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bronchitis, abdominal pain, headache and dizziness. Administering oseltamivir after meals helps reduce nausea.\n\nRelated Links on MedicineNet.com\n\nPage 2 of this Article\nThe Doctor's Response\nInformation on this web site is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

{"question": "can I call different dentists to get an estimate on a root canal?", "patient_answer": "No you can't call around and get a quote on a root canal from different dentists.  It's not like buying car insurance. You will not be able to get a price from a dentist without him/her seeing you first. By law they can not quote you a price for a procedure without seeing you first. It's the same thing as calling a Dr. you've never seen before and asking them to diagnose your problem over the phone. It can't be done. There are many types of root canals and they all cost different prices. It also depends on what tooth it is and what kind of crown the dentist will put on it. Most people think there's a set fee for this type of procedure but that isn't the case. It is a case by case scenario and if you feel like the price is too high at your current dentist I reccomend getting a copy of your xray and getting a second opinion.  Normally for a root canal and a crown you are looking at spending around $900 for both. Of course, if you have insurance then the price would be drastically less.  Some dentists have payment plans/options and I would look into that if you are paying cash for this. Good luck, I have had a root canal and crown myself and it's not fun!", "doctor_answer": "You have the right to be a consumer and try to get a bargain.  I take it that either A) you don't have dental insurance, or B) your insurance doesn't cover it or covers little.  Most dentists will be more than happy to provide the cost for the procedure."}
{"question": "What causes bad breath and how do you get rid of it?", "patient_answer": "The clinical term for bad breath is halitosis.  Bad breath is primarily caused by poor oral hygiene, but can also can be caused by retained food particles or gum disease. Proper brushing including brushing the tongue, cheeks, and the roof of the mouth will remove bacteria and food particles. Flossing removes accumulated bacteria, plaque and food that may be trapped between teeth. Mouth rinses are effective in temporary relief of bad breath. Consult your dentist and/or physician if the condition persists.\n\nIt is important to practice good oral hygiene, such as brushing and flossing your teeth at least twice a day. To alleviate the odor, clean your tongue with your toothbrush or a tongue scraper, a plastic tool that scrapes away bacteria that builds on the tongue. Chewing sugar-free gum also may help control the odor. If you have dentures or a removable appliance, such as a retainer or mouthguard, clean the appliance thoroughly before placing it back in your mouth. Before you use mouth rinses, deodorizing sprays or tablets, talk with your dentist because these products only mask the odor temporarily, and some products work better than others.", "doctor_answer": "Bad breath mainly comes from food particles stuck in your teeth, gums, and tongue. As time passes, the food starts to break down causing an odor, which is why your dentists tells you to brush, if possible, after a meal, and use mouth wash to rinse away left over food particles."}

{"question": "how do I treat an allergic reaction to fish or shrimp?", "patient_answer": "The obvious answer is to avoid fish or shrimp in the future.

If the swelling progresses, go to an emergency room immediately - if the mouth and/or throat swells, it could be fatal so quickly you could not react in time.", "doctor_answer": "Janet has the right idea. NO MORE FISH/SHRIMP for you. Make sure you tell people at resturants not to let your food come in contact with and fish/fish oils  or anything else you may be allergic too. Keep medication for swelling/itching handy in your car/purse/wallet/pocket for safey reasons. It may save your life."}

Usually symptoms gradually improve within 2 to 5 days. If your child does not respond to this or has severe croup, medications may be used to decrease swelling.

{"question": "What should I eat or not eat to help prevent a herpes outbreak?", "patient_answer": "Lysine is one of numerous amino acids that the body needs for growth and tissue repair. It is classified as one of the nine \"essential\" amino acids because you need to get it from outside sources such as foods or supplements--in other words the body can't make it on its own.\n\n Researchers are exploring the value of lysine supplementation and the consumption of lysine-rich foods for lowering cholesterol, improving athletic performance, and enhancing recovery after surgery.\n\nSome nutritionally oriented physicians and dentists recommend taking lysine during an outbreak of canker sores to speed healing. The exact cause of these tiny but quite painful mouth ulcers is unclear, but most research indicates that a virus is responsible. However, there have been almost no clinical trials using lysine as a remedy for canker sores.\n\nThe most promising application of lysine is its use in managing and preventing painful and unsightly herpes sores caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).\n\nSpecifically, lysine may help to:\n\n# Prevent and relieve cold sores (herpes). Exciting research over the past several decades suggests that lysine may be helpful in controlling herpes simplex-related infections. There are two types of this virus: type 1, which typically causes cold sores or fever blisters around the mouth, and type 2, which tends to cause genital sores. However, both forms can cause eruptions around the mouth or on the genitals. Once infected with the virus, you have it permanently. It may lie dormant, but it doesn't go away. Outbreaks are usually painful and unsightly, as well as contagious.\n\nA few years ago, researchers discovered that in order to grow (replicate), the herpes virus needs arginine, another common amino acid. (Foods high in arginine include chocolate, peanuts, almonds, seeds, cereal grains, gelatin, and raisins.) Lysine competes with arginine for absorption and entry into tissue cells. And when lysine is present, it inhibits the growth of HSV by knocking out arginine.\n\nThis makes a diet high in lysine and low in arginine a useful tool in managing HSV infections. In a recent study, participants consumed large amounts of lysine (about 1 gram three times each day) while restricting food sources of arginine. A significant number of participants (74%) noticed an improvement in their HSV infections and a decrease in the number of outbreaks.\n\n-As a side note, broccoli is also one of the better vegetable to help your body in keeping outbreaks at bay.", "doctor_answer": "human sexual body parts\n\noh you may have already done that..sorry"}

{"question": "How long does it take for chlamydia to cause permanent damage?", "patient_answer": "There's no need to be embarassed.  You got during unprotected sex from a partner who didn't know they were carrying the disease.  \nMales can be asymptomatic carriers and give it to everyone with whom they have sex.  Yes, you could have experienced permanent damage already.  The recommendations of a doctor visit for a hysterosalpingogram (x-ray with dye) or hysteroscopy, should you eventually suffer infertility, are warranted.  Unless you are trying to get pregnant now, don't worry about it now.  The damage done now will still be there later.  Tubes don't \"unscar\" themselves.  Tell all your partners that you have been infected so they can be treated also.  And for goodness sake, don't have unprotected sex unless you both have been tested and are negative for STDs.", "doctor_answer": "Why don't you try to trace it back to whoever you got it from.\nThats a good idea anyway, since you should inform people that you've been with recently that you have it.

{"question": "How does someone get pneumonia?", "patient_answer": "Usually common in a person with a reduced immnunity, to infection, in most cases it is caused by either a virus or bacteria. causes of viral pneumonia include adenovirus, respitory syncytial virus, the most common bacterial pneumonia is caused by streptococcus pneumoniae.  commonly occurs in alcoholics,the elderly, infants or as a complication to a serious illness", "doctor_answer": "Pneumonia is often classified into two categories that may help predict the organisms that are the most likely culprits. \n\n1.  Community-acquired (pneumonia contracted outside the hospital). Pneumonia in this setting often follows a viral respiratory infection. It affects nearly 4 million adults each year. It is likely to be caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common pneumonia-causing bacteria. Other organisms, such as atypical bacteria called Chlamydia or Mycoplasma pneumonia are also common causes of community-acquired pneumonia. \n\n2.  Hospital-acquired pneumonia. Pneumonia that is contracted within the hospital is called nosocomial pneumonia. Hospital patients are particularly vulnerable to gram-negative bacteria and staphylococci, which can be very dangerous."}
{"question": "Why do my ears feel like they should be \"popped\" when I lift weights.?", "patient_answer": "YOU DAMN STUD...Your lifting such heavy weights and your looking so good your head is swelling. You see your sub conscience knows that all the women in the gym want you and all the guys fear you and jealous of how high your bench is......", "doctor_answer": "It has been found that muscular tightness in the neck and shoulders pulling on ears can actually cause ears to plug up. When our ears get plugged from muscular tension, it can prevent them from draining properly, and be a contributing factor in the development of sinus and ear infections. Supposidly yoga and trigger point therapy are remedies.\n\nTrigger point therapy is a form of self massage that is great for loosening up tight muscles. It works well on its own, but combined with yoga it can be a very effective and low cost way of eliminating pain and relaxing muscular tension. By relaxing muscles that may be tight and pulling downward on the ears, trigger point therapy helps ears to open up and drain better, reducing the possibility of trapped bacteria causing sinus infections and eliminating a feeling of fullness and pressure in the ears."}

I WAS TOLD BY THE PHARMAIST IT WAS AN EXPENSIVE ALEVE.", "doctor_answer": "\"Ultram\" is just one of the brand names for the drug Tramadol.\n\nRegarding dependence/addiction:\n\nSome controversy exists regarding the dependence liability of tramadol. Grünenthal has promoted it as an opioid with \"little\" risk of dependence, claiming little evidence of such dependence in their clinical trials. They offer the theory that since the M1 metabolite is the principal agonist at μ-opioid receptors, the delayed agonist activity reduces dependence liability.\n\nDespite these claims it is apparent, in community practice, that dependence does occur to this agent. This would be expected since analgesic and dependence effects are mediated by the same μ-opioid receptor. However, this dependence liability is considered relatively low by health authorities, such that tramadol is classified as a Schedule 4 [Prescription Only Medicine] in Australia, rather than as a Schedule 8 [Controlled Drug] like other opioids (Rossi, 2004).\n\nHere are some of the effects you may experience:\n\nPOSITIVE\n    * Pain relief\n    * Sense of well-being (6-8 hours)\n    * Positive outlook \n\nNEUTRAL\n    * Itching (increases with dosage)\n    * Stimulation (physical and mental)\n    * Sweating\n    * Agitation\n    * Tremor \n\nNEGATIVE\n    * Tolerance (requiring more of the drug to achieve the desired pain relief)\n    * Nausea or vomiting (some people find alleviation by eating before ingesting)\n    * Constipation or diarrhea (including upon abrupt cessation of use)\n    * Difficulty urinating or increased urination\n    * Dizziness, vertigo, reduced coordination, dis-equilibrium\n    * Headache\n    * Weakness\n    * Anxiety\n    * Heartburn\n    * Tiredness, \"nodding\", respiratory depression at high dose"}

{"question": "best hospital in cancer?", "patient_answer": "mayo clinic in rochester,mn", "doctor_answer": "Dont go the the accepted hospitals.  Go to the doctors that specialize in cancer all across the USA.  They have their own cures.  To be honest, it can be cured, and with 90% survival rate if you dont have a level 3 cancer.  But, when doctors give up, you can still survive up to 80%.   Not only that, some remedies sold over the internet can even cure you with high survival rates.  Please read this.  I have written it for several yahooers battling cancer, but you should read it if you need.  Here goes:\n(To be honest, chemotherapy is not a cancer treatment. Here is the situation. Chemo can take care of the problem right away, but the doctor always says that, some can live an extended 2 years, or 3 years. And some die right away from the chemicals. This is with late stages of cancer. Now, for early stages, it helps the problem but your health is deteriorated. They say that chemo affects the cancer and your normal body cells. How many people you know, who have had late stages of cancer, and lived through it pass 5 yours with chemo therapy? I bet you that you have never even heard of it. Even if someone has, how many people is that compared to that masses? The problem with other medicines is that the pharmaceautical companies cannot control that product. What if it was tree bark say for instance. How many people do you know will buy the pills if they can just walk up to any tree and bite a piece off to save themselves? See? So, USA doctors are familiar with these remedies, but they do not talk about it. Try asking your doctor about green algae, or cesium chloride, or paw paw, etc etc. Then they start to talk. Otherwise, they wont say a word. And if you dont know, how can you ask? So, the doctors lips are sealed tight. The individual doctors on the other hand are sometimes scared to talk about it. It is because, if they open their mouths, they would be facing the whole medical community. Alot of them go into the medical field to help people, and some go in it for money. But, the top ranking ones in control are all in it for money. If not, they would have never gotten their position. I do not suggest you go with chemo therapy. You can look up some alternative medicine to cancer and they are all over the place on the net. The best ranked one is cesium chloride, paw paw, and along with others. Some health websites even have a place where you can go and tell them your stage of cancer and which type of cancer, and they will sell you a package based on your individual problem. There are also some doctors scattered all over the USA who specialize in cancer. You never hear about them right? Well, they wont be bothered by the medical community if they do a small operation without much advertising. But, they all report about 90% survival rates on cancers that regular cancer doctors give up on. And if that doctor didnt give up, do you expect to live anyways? No. I speak out to you because I dont want you to die like the two of my friends who have already died. Certain doctors even said that they could cure it with 80% survival rate. But, I didnt have the money to help them. So, I am speaking out in hopes that nothing happens to you and you survive. Regardless of your stage of cancer. Cesium chloride is what works best. Look it up, its everywhere. Even oxygen drops help. You can use them both at the same time. The thing is with these alternatives is that, some of them make you feel extremely bad at the beginning, but after a while you get used to it, and then you are gone with the cancer before you know it. So dont feel discouraged. Oxygen drops keep cancer from growing because your body can live with more oxygen. As a matter of fact, it helps circulate your blood. Cancer cannot live at the sight of oxygen. It has been said that not enough oxygen is what causes cancer. I dont know what the cause is, because there are many causes. But, cesium chloride and oxygen drops will take care of it. And one more thing, some of these remedies cannot be sol"}

{"question": "What causes dark circles under the eyes?", "patient_answer": "too much of stress for eyes, and less sleep.", "doctor_answer": "Black or dark circles under or around the eyes can be caused by many different factors. The following are the most common causes of those unattractive dark circles.\nHEREDITY\nLike varicose veins, dark circles under the eyes are usually an inherited trait. If you have dark circles, there is a good chance that others in your family also have them. The skin under the eye is very thin. When blood passes through the large veins close to the surface of the skin it can produce a bluish tint. The more transparent your skin, also an inherited trait, the darker the circles appear.\n\nEXPOSURE TO THE SUN\nEven in darker skinned people, exposure to sunlight, especially during the summer months, can cause a higher-than-normal level of skin pigmentation (melanin) under the eyes. People get sun tans because exposure to the sun increases the natural pigmentation of the skin and draws that pigmentation to the surface. The same principle applies to the skin under the eyes.\n\nALLERGIES, ASTHMA and ECZEMA\nAny condition that you have that causes your eyes to itch can contribute to darker circles under the eyes because rubbing or scratching the skin can darken the skin. Hay fever sufferers particularly will notice under-eye \"smudges\" during the height of the allergy season. Some food allergies can also cause the area under the eyes to appear darker.\n\nMEDICATIONS\nAny medications that you are taking that causes blood vessels to dilate, can cause circles under the eyes to darken. Because the skin under the eyes is very delicate, any increase blood flow shows through the skin.\n\nNUTRITION\nThe lack of nutrients in the diet, or the lack of a balance diet, can contribute to the discoloration of the area under the eyes.\n\nFATIGUE, LACK OF SLEEP\nA lack of sleep or excessive tiredness can cause paleness of the skin, which again allows the blood underneath the skin to become more visible and appear more blue or darker.\n\nPREGNANCY and MENSTRUATION\nThe skin can also become more pale during pregnancy and menstruation, which again allows the underlying veins under the eyes to become more visible.\n\nAGE\nIf you have a propensity to have dark circles under you eyes, as you grow older, they are likely to become more noticeable and permanent. Excess folds of skin under the eyes will also make dark circles more pronounced."}

{"question": "what is vasectomy?", "patient_answer": "How common is vasectomy?\nVasectomy is used as a means of contraception in many parts of the world. A total of about 50 million men have had a vasectomy--a number that corresponds to roughly 5 percent of all married couples of reproductive age. In comparison, about 15 percent of couples rely on female sterilization for birth control.\n\nApproximately half a million vasectomies are performed in the United States each year. About one out of six men over age 35 has been vasectomized. The prevalence of men undergoing the procedure increases with higher levels of education and income. Among married couples in the United States, only female sterilization and oral contraception are relied upon more often for family planning.\n\nHow is vasectomy done?\nIn the conventional approach, a physician makes one or two small incisions, or cuts, in the skin of the scrotum, which has been numbed with a local anesthetic. The vas is cut, and a small piece may be removed. Next, the doctor ties the cut ends and sews up the scrotal incision. The entire procedure is then repeated on the other side.\n\nRelated Links on MedicineNet.com \n\nPage 2 of this Article \nRelated Medical Procedures and Tests\nThe Doctor's Response\nInformation on this web site is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Vasectomy is a popular method of birth control: in 1983, figures showed that approximately 10 million men had been sterilized in the U.S. since 1969. Excision of the vas deferens is a minor surgical procedure that can be performed in a physician's office in less than half an hour. A small incision is made on one side of the scrotum (the external sac housing the testes) and the vas deferens is located, cut, and the ends tied off. The incision is closed and the procedure is repeated on the other side. After surgery, it is necessary to wait until a negative sperm count is obtained before discarding other means of contraception, because viable sperm cells are retained in the seminal vesicles (the pair of storage pouches where sperm is mixed with other components of semen) and along the various sperm ducts. In addition it is usually advised that the patient be reexamined after a year, because the severed ends of the vas deferens occasionally reknit. Sterility resulting from vasectomy is considered to be permanent, and attempts at surgically reversing vasectomy, called vasovasotomy, have had limited success. In India, where the government is trying to stem the tide of overpopulation, money is paid to men who submit to voluntary vasectomy. Efforts to overcome the irreversibility of vasectomy have also led to experimentation with the implantation of faucetlike devices that can be made to open or close the sperm duct in a simple operation. Such devices have functioned successfully in animals but are still considered experimental in humans because of their unproved reversibility, high cost, and the degree of surgical skill needed to implant them. Another option suggested to those undergoing vasectomy is to preserve their fertility by depositing semen in sperm banks. Such semen samples are frozen in liquid nitrogen below −300°F (−185°F) and are considered to be viable for an indefinite period.

{"question": "I am looking for a website where i can read about people with schizophrenia and are medicationfree?", "patient_answer": "The word \"schizophrenia\" is simply a label used to categorise a list of psychosocial traits that Psychiatry considers to be improper or abnormal in society. Psychiatry defines these traits as a \"mental illness\", and promotes it as a \"disease\" that requires \"treatment\".\n\nIt is not a \"disease\", despite claims made in certain peoples answers here. There is NO credible scientific evidence that shows the existence of what constitutes \"schizophrenia\" as a biological/neurological disorder, brain abnormality or \"chemical imbalance\".\n\n\"For a disease to exist there must be a tangible, objective physical abnormality that can be determined by a test such as, but not limited to, blood or urine test, X-Ray, brain scan or biopsy. All reputable doctors would agree: No physical abnormality, no disease. In psychiatry, no test or brain scan exists to prove that a 'mental disorder' is a physical disease. Disingenuous comparisons between physical and mental illness and medicine are simply part of psychiatry's orchestrated but fraudulent public relations and marketing campaign.\" Fred A. Baughman Jr., MD (Neurologist, Pediatric Neurology), & Fellow at the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n\"Chemical imbalance…it’s a shorthand term really, it’s probably drug industry derived… We don’t have tests because to do it, you’d probably have to take a chunk of brain out of someone - not a good idea.\" Dr. Mark Graff, Chair of the Committee of Public Affairs for the American Psychiatric Association. July, 2005.\n\nSymptoms that psychiatry labels as \"schizophrenia\" (or it's related disorders), can stem from any number of variable sources. Many people have overcome disorders such as \"bipolar\" and \"schizophrenia\" through effective megavitamin therapy and effective nutrition. A growing wealth of evidence supports that underlying nutritional deficiencies can cause even the most severe mental disorders, including \"schizophrenia\". [1,2,3,4,5,6] \n\nYou may also be interested to know that the work undertaken by pioneers such as Dr. Lars Martensson and the late Dr. Loren Mosher show that there is also another way - far safer and more effective than psychiatric restraint, drugs and electro-shocks. For over a decade Loren R Mosher, MD, held a central position in American psychiatric research. He was the first Chief of the Center for Studies of Schizophrenia at the National Institute of Mental Health, 1969-1980. He founded the Schizophrenia Bulletin and for ten years he was its Editor-in-Chief. He also led the Soteria Project, which demonstrated that effective rehabilitation is possible without harmful antipsychotic drugs. Soteria provided a safe and sane environment where schizophrenic patients could stay, medication-free, with a young, nonprofessional staff trained to listen to and understand them and provide companionship. The idea was that schizophrenia can often be overcome with the help of meaningful relationships, rather than with drugs, and that such treatment would eventually lead to unquestionably healthier lives. The results were fantastic. Over just 6 weeks, patients recovered as quickly as those treated with medication in hospitals. [7,8] \n\nBottom line? Psychiatry is a belief-system, a \"faith\", not a science. Despite the huge marketing strategies, the so-called \"research\" and all the propaganda thrown at the world, there is not one iota of scientific evidence that proves that \"schizophrenia\" or ANY mental illness, in fact, exists as an actual --medical disease--.\n\nIf you have been told differently then know this: You have been lied to.\n\nFor more information, please visit:\n\nhttp://groups.msn.com/psychbusters\nDecoding Psychiatric Propaganda\n\nSee also http://www.alternativementalhealth.com/articles/default.htm#S\n\nAnd http://www.webcom.com/thrive/schizo/", "doctor_answer": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disease.

{"question": "what is the best diet to lose weight?", "patient_answer": "The basics of most nutrition books\nDon’t starve yourself. That’s the worst thing you can do in a diet because it slows down your metabolism and your body starts getting more fat from your food intake since, fat is the bodies fastest and easiest type of nutrition[not the healthiest though]. The reason this happen is because this helped us when we were no doing so good as hunters and gathers to keep us alive a bit longer. \n\nBefore I continue let me explain protein, carbohydrates, and fats.\n\nProtein is easiest described as anything that comes from or was an animal such chicken, fish, sirloin, and milk. \n\nCarbohydrates [carbs] can be found almost in anything else even apples.\nGood carbs:\nApples, wheat bread, sourdough bread, grains, and wheat \nBad carbs:\nWhite bread, hamburger buns, hotdog buns, Doritos, and sodas!\n\nGood fats:\nAvocados, pecans, almonds, and peanut butter \n\nThe ratio in your diet varies but I think a good starting point is something like\n[50%Protien:40%Carbs:10%fat]\n\nThis can sound meaningless. So in plain terms consume only good fats [portioned] and you should be okay.  Something like a handful of almonds, or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [separately. not consecutively]. \n\nThe reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because you are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [Proteins are 4 calories, Carbs are 4 calories, Fats are 9 calories] so theoretically if you eat less fats and more proteins you will have a less appetite because you will eat more. \n\nAnother nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself. That’s how the Adkins basically works. If you consume more proteins and less carbs you will lose weight. I leave to you to decide if this is good you.\n\nI would also advice you to split up your day into 5 meals. [warning: it will feel weird because you are not used to eating this decreased amount. Just keep in mind that you will eat in 3 hour and you will quickly noticed that you will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry] if you do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla.\n\nYou are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [if you have been starving yourself or if you don’t exercise].", "doctor_answer": "A  balanced diet.

{"question": "my husband cheated iwant to forgive him but it hurts so bad?", "patient_answer": "I wish I could say \"forgive\" and forget. But it isn't that easy.

Yes, but you will find that those who have usually had a deep life-changing religious experience.

I have been cheated on, I have been hurt until I didn't think I could hurt any more, I have forgiven, and I have been hurt right back again. This is not a vindictive response.

{"question": "How do i manage type II or type 2 diabetes?", "patient_answer": "Your doctor should have advice specific to you, but the American Diabetes Association offers the Diabetes Learning Center (online information for managing meal planning, nutrition, complications, etc. at http://www.diabetes.org/all-about-diabetes/chan_eng/channel.htm\n\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease also provides the Diabetes Information Clearinghouse, with information on treatments, complications, etc. at http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/", "doctor_answer": "The answers given to you previously (about researching the ADA, other organzations) is good advice, but not really that specific. Sometimes you need to do more to get the help you need than just do online research. \nThe best advice that I have is to talk to your doctor to work up an individualized treatment plan for your diabetes. Not everyone's diabetes works the same do the uniqueness of the human body and differences from person to person. \nAlso, seek out your local public health resources for valuable (and usually free of charge) education relating to diabetes. Your local health department would be a great place to start your search for resources. \n\nSome basic diabetes pointers:\n-- Eat a healthy diet. Reduce your sugar intake to minimal (not nonexistent though -- you have to have some sugar to have energy), low fat, low carb, etc. Also, pay special attention to your portion sizes at meals. Even eating too much of some health-conscious foods can be harmful to your blood sugar levels. Consider talking to a dietician.\n-- Take your medications regularly. Try to take them around the same time every day to maintain constant, consistent levels in your system. Only take the dosage prescribed. Don't alter your dose to self-treat high / low sugar levels. \n-- Monitor your blood sugars at home on a daily basis. (I usually monitor first thing in the morning and 2 hours after each meal, but talk to your doctor and see what he / she wants  you to do as far as a monitoring schedule goes.)\n-- Exercise. Getting out and moving around, walking, running, etc. are all great for helping keep a check on your blood sugar levels. Some resources do say, however, that if you do a self-check on your sugar and get a level of 300 or more, DO NOT exercise. Talk to you doctor and get his / her recommendation for your exercise plan. \n\nIt basically all comes down to you as to how well you manage your diabetes. While it is a terrible condition (I know, I have it too...), you can live a long and healthy life with proper measures of control. Work with your doctor and come up with a treatment plan. \nGood luck and best wishes....."}

Occasionally, diabetic neuropathy can flare up suddenly and affect specific nerves so that an affected individual will develop double vision or drooping eyelids, or weakness and atrophy of the thigh muscles. Nerve damage caused by diabetes generally occurs over a period of years and may lead to problems with the digestive tract and sexual organs, which can cause indigestion, diarrhea or constipation, dizziness, bladder infections, and impotence.

{"question": "WHat are some ways to alleviate migraines?", "patient_answer": "I feel your pain!  Generally speaking, it isn't known what triggers migraines.  I tried avoiding potential triggers based upon my trial by fire experience.  For instance I soon had a migraine after consuming chocolate, cashews and food containing M.S.G.  So I avoided those things but the migraines persisted.  I tried making sure I went to the chiropractor which helped some but not as effectively as I wanted.  After the last occurrence, I finally sought out my doctor and had a very frank chat.  After she asked many questions we realized that the migraines were more frequent through the last few years and may be due to hormonal changes.  So she prescribe a medication that I take one time before bed. I'm to keep a journal of any headaches but especially migraines to see if the medicine works in helping to prevent or decrease their occurrence.  She also prescribed a medicine to take when the onset of a migraine occurs.  This one is supposed to stop it in it's tracks.

{"question": "How can I increase my concentration and focus?", "patient_answer": "I would highly recommend a 10-day vipassana meditation course (http://www.dhamma.org/vipassan.htm ) if you can get the time off. I think it's definitely worth it, so keep it in mind.\n\nIt's very intense, over 10 hours of meditation a day for 10 days, complete silence (except with the teachers), and guidance instructions basically broken up into hour-chunks. It might seem intimidating but it's very doable and you just need to have the intention to do it.\n\nAlso it's helpful to go somewhere that's structured so you can get a \"jumpstart\" and learn it, and it'll stay with you for the rest of your life... like if you just say you're going to exercise regularly by yourself it's hard to be disciplined enough to do it, but if you learn it over a period of time it's more likely to stay with you.\n\nAlso it's non-sectarian, anyone can practice it, and it's free from any dogma, blind belief, etc.\n\nAlso (again) the courses are free, by donation only, and no recommended or forced donation. Even the room and board are provided, because past students have found it to be beneficial so it's supported entirely by donation.\n\nVery intense but since it's so rigorous most people see distinct benefits after only 10 days.", "doctor_answer": "Learn meditation.

{"question": "tell me about stress thalium test to know the health of heart  and also let me know how is it done?", "patient_answer": "Thallium Stress Test\n\nWhat is a thallium stress test? \nThis is a type of nuclear scanning test or myocardial perfusion (mi\"o-KAR'de-al per-FU'zhun) imaging test. It shows how well blood flows to the heart muscle. It's usually done along with an exercise stress test on a treadmill or bicycle.\n\nThe thallium stress test is useful to determine:\n\nExtent of a coronary artery blockage\nPrognosis of patients who've suffered a heart attack\nEffectiveness of cardiac procedures done to improve circulation in coronary arteries\nCause(s) of chest pain\nLevel of exercise that a patient can safely perform\nWhen the patient reaches his or her maximum level of exercise, a small amount of a radioactive substance called thallium is injected into the bloodstream. Then the patient lies down on a special table under a camera (\"gamma camera\") that can see the thallium and make pictures. The thallium mixes with the blood in the bloodstream and heart's arteries and enters heart muscle cells. If a part of the heart muscle doesn't receive a normal blood supply, less than a normal amount of thallium will be in those heart muscle cells.\n\nThe first pictures are made shortly after the exercise test and show blood flow to the heart during exercise. The heart is \"stressed\" during the exercise test -- thus the name \"stress test.\" The patient then lies quietly for 2-3 hours and another series of pictures is made. These show blood flow to the heart muscle during rest.", "doctor_answer": "Your doctor will generally order a Thallium Stress Test to look for certain conditions in your heart. \n\nThis is a scintillation scan (gamma camera or photoscan) involving the use of thallium-201, a radioisotope. The radioisotope is administered intravenously and localizes, like calcium, in the myocardium (heart muscle). A scintillation camera produces an image of the distribution of the radioisotope. Areas of inadequate perfusion (blood flow) appear as \"cold spots,\" thus pinpointing sites of myocardium (heart muscle) at risk."}

{"question": "How long does it take to heal a toe amputation when the patient has very limited blood circulation?", "patient_answer": "The time it takes to heal any wound depends on several things. Good circulation to the area helps with healing. It brings nutrients and oxygen that are needed to heal. You can't let your blood sugar levels be too high. If someones blood sugar is too high then basically they may never heal the wound. Also make sure that you are getting enough protein in your diet. Protein is what your body uses to repair skin.\nYou may want to consider visiting a wound care clinic. We have one in our area. On certain patients they are able to put them in a bariatric chamber which saturates the body with oxygen to promote healing. Hope this helps!", "doctor_answer": "The healing time of any amputation depends on the circulation at the level of the stump. It also can be affected by how well controlled the person's diabetes is.\n\nWhen we amputate, we make sure that there is adequate circulation to heal the stump.\n\nIf the toe stump you refer to hasn't healed in a month, there's a problem and the toe needs to be re-evaluated.

{"question": "what is blood pressure?", "patient_answer": "blood pressure, force exerted by the blood upon the walls of the arteries. The pressure in the arteries originates in the pumping action of the heart, and pressure waves can be felt at the wrist and at other points where arteries lie near the surface of the body (see pulse). Since the heart can pump blood into the large arteries more quickly than it can be absorbed and released by the tiny arterioles and capillaries, considerable inner pressure always exists in the arteries. The contraction of the heart (systole) causes the blood pressure to rise to its highest point, and relaxation of the heart (diastole) brings the pressure down to its lowest point.\nBlood pressure is strongest in the aorta, where the blood leaves the heart. It diminishes progressively in the smaller blood vessels and reaches its lowest point in the veins (see circulatory system). Blood pressure manifests itself dramatically when an artery is severed or pierced and the blood (under pressure) ejects in spurts.", "doctor_answer": "It is as hard as your heart has to beat to keep adiminte control of your blood pressure"}

{"question": "What is Insulin Shock and how do you prevent it?", "patient_answer": "Insulin shock is a severe condition in which glucose (blood sugar) levels drop quickly, leading to dizziness, vision problems, shaking, seizures, fainting and unconsciousness.\n-----------------\nMethods of prevention vary depending on the cause of the hypoglycemia.\nDrug-induced Hypoglycemia\n\nThe first step in preventing drug-induced hypoglycemia is to maintain a proper diet. Diabetics may also find it necessary to monitor their blood-sugar levels on a regular basis. Low blood-sugar levels indicate that a person should immediately eat candy or some other sweet snack. Insulin pumps are also effective in maintaining the proper level of blood sugar. These pumps can be implanted under the skin and programmed to continuously release the correct amount of insulin.\nIdiopathic Hypoglycemia\n\nIdiopathic hypoglycemia can usually be controlled by learning and following certain dietary rules. These rules include the following:\n\n    * Avoid overeating.\n    * Never skip breakfast.\n    * Include protein in all meals and snacks.\n    * Limit intake of fats, refined sugar, and processed foods.\n    * Become familiar with the sugar content in different kinds of vegetables and grain products.\n    * Keep a food diary that can be used to predict which foods produce the symptoms of hypoglycemia.\n    * Eat a regular but limited amount of fresh fruits.\n    * Follow a diet that is high in fiber.", "doctor_answer": "If I recall, Insulin shock occurs when your blood sugar drops dramatically.

Ancient Greek and Roman literature even discusses primitive toothpicks that were chewed on to help clean the teeth and mouth.\n\nAs the years passed, toothpicks matured into the chew stick which was about the size of a modern pencil. One end was chewed into and became softened and brush-like while the opposite end was pointed and used as a pick to clean food and debris from between the teeth. The twigs used were carefully chosen from aromatic trees that had the ability to clean and freshen the mouth. The earliest literature showing the use of these twigs is found in Chinese literature at around 1600 BC.\n\nThe first true bristled toothbrush also originated in China at around 1600 AD. At around 1780, the first toothbrush was made by William Addis of Clerkenald, England. Addis, and later, his descendants, manufactured the finest English brushes, where the handles were carved out of the bone of cattle and the heads of the natural bristles were placed in the bored holes made in the bone and kept in place by thin wire. The natural bristles were obtained from the necks and shoulders of swine, especially from pigs living in colder climates like Siberia and China.\n\nBy the early 1800s the bristled brushes were in general use in Europe and Japan. In 1857, H. N. Wadsworth was credited as the first American to receive a toothbrush patent as America entered the growing toothbrush market. In 1844, the first toothbrush was manufactured by hand and patented as a 3-row brush of serrated bristles with larger tufts by Dr. Meyer L. Rhein. In 1885, the Florence Manufacturing Company of Massachusetts, in association with Dr.Rhein, began producing the Pro-phy-lac-tic brush for mass marketing in the United States.\n\nAs technology progressed, synthetic bristles replaced the natural swine bristles. Nylon was first applied to the toothbrush at around 1938 and by 1939, electric toothbrushes arrived in an attempt to offer the public a brush that could simulate the action of a manual brush but with better results and cleaning performance.\n\nHard to believe, but most Americans didn't brush their teeth until soldiers brought the Army's enforced habit back home from World War II. The first real electric toothbrush was produced in 1939, developed in Switzerland. The electrical toothbrush was first marketed in the United States in 1960 by Squibb. The brush was called the Broxodent. General Electric introduced a rechargeable cordless toothbrush in 1961. Interplak was the first rotary action electrical toothbrush for home use, introduced in 1987.", "doctor_answer": "the tooth fairy??? :0"}

{"question": "weightlifting routines for beginners?", "patient_answer": "Basic power exercises such as bench press, barbell curls, etc.  Or if you are at a gym you can use the machines that work the large muscle groups.  \n\nA good beginning routine would be 2 sets of 10-12 reps   using a split training routine.  Such as:\n\nMonday:  Chest and Back 30 minutes of cardio\nTuesday:  Deltoids, biceps, triceps 30 min of cardio\nWednesday:  Legs\nThursday:  Rest \nRepeat as you can for the rest of the week.

{"question": "what are the implications of the ovarian retention cyst in fertility and how is it been treated.The drugs .?", "patient_answer": "Hold UP ... First of all, antibiotics have nothing to do with treating an ovarian cyst.  I was just diagnosed with an one and initially, there is NOTHING that they will do to treat it.  \n\nBased on the information that I found from researching, ovarian cysts are common in women (especially pre-menopausal) and the cyst usually takes care of itself by either absorbing back into the system or bursting (like a pimple).\n\nFollicle retention cysts (the predominant ovarian cysts) are simple follicle retention cysts, small and frequently numerous cysts containing a clear fluid. A follicle is the localized area of the ovary in which the egg matures. When ovulation does not occur, the follicle may continue to grow, forming a cystic mass that rarely exceeds two or three inches in diameter. Usually, follicle cysts disappear without treatment within two months, and they do not become malignant growths.\n\nGood luck!  I know the pain is unbearable at times!!", "doctor_answer": "If it is an ovarian cysts, then the egg is staying in the ovary instead of properly ovulating, so it will affect fertility.

{"question": "How far up does the penis have to go in order to tear the hymen.?", "patient_answer": "The hymen (also known under the slang names cherry and maidenhead) is a membrane which completely or partially occludes the vaginal opening in human females. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \"membrane\", and is also the name of the classical Greek god of marriage.\nBecause sexual activity would usually tear this membrane, its presence has been considered a guarantor of virginity in societies that place a high value on female chastity before marriage. However, the hymen is a poor indicator of whether a woman has actually engaged in coitus, because the tissue may be torn or stretched through masturbation, or tampon use and other non-sexual acts before having sexual intercourse. Also, some females with intact hymens have had sexual intercourse.\n\nThe size and shape of this opening (or openings) vary greatly from person to person. Some women are born with no hymen at all, while others have a closed or imperforate hymen. These women may require a gynecologist to perform a medical procedure called a hymenotomy to allow menstrual products to escape. Still other women have unusually thick hymens that may require a hymenotomy to prevent pain for the woman during sex.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymen\nHYMEN \nA thin piece of skin that stretches over the opening of the vagina. There is a small opening in it to let blood flow out of the vagina during a period. People used to think that a HYMEN that wasn't broken meant a girl was a virgin. Now we know that it has a small hole in it that can get stretched more just from running, playing or using tampons. Some girls are even born without a HYMEN. \nhttp://www.teensource.org/RunScript.asp?page=174&word=h&Poll_ID=4&p=ASP&#92;Pg174.asp\n\nHymen is also an alternate name for the Greek god Hymenaios.", "doctor_answer": "This is definitely a question for your ob/gyn.

It is normal and healthy for a man to \"pleasure himself\".  Abstain from pornography, which is a terrible addiction that can only lead to worse things (take it from a psychology student who has suffered from it and studied the sorrows of porn addiction).  Maybe once a week, draw a nice bath, and provide yourself with a pleasurable, drawn out experience.  Take your time to enjoy everything about it.  The rest of the time, just satisfy the urge when it bites, and nothing more.  Don't let it take over your life.  And don't let feelings of shame mentally torture you either.  Maybe you should get some good counseling from a professional.  That would probably be a great help for you.

{"question": "What are some good ways to stop smoking cigarettes.?", "patient_answer": "Methods of quitting\nCold Turkey method\nNicotine Replacement Methods (Patch, Gum, Nasal Spray)\nBehavioral Methods\nCognitive Therapy Method\nOther Methods and adjuncts (acupuncture, hypnosis, medications)\nFactors for relapse while in the process of quitting\nPredictors of successful quitting\nCold turkey method\nThis is the prefered method used by so called self changers, people who quit on their own and without any nicotine replacement by gum, patch or nasal spray. Little is known about this method as any research study would influence the results as it would no longer be a spontaneous process. Strong motivational factors are believed to play the foremost role in successful quitting using this method.\nNicotine replacement therapy\nIn this method the nicotine delivered by the cigarette is replaced with nicotine delivered through the skin (transdermal nicotine or nicotine patch) , the nasal mucosa (nicotine nasal spray) or the buccal mucosa (nicotine chewing gum). Several well designed clinical trials have shown the efficacy and safety of nicotine replacement the goal of which is to reduce cravings and ease withdrawal symptoms.\n\n      Transdermal Nicotine Patches\n      The nicotine patch is usually well tolerated, and provides constant, steady nicotine blood levels throughout the day and night when worn. They are quite simple to use, help prevent weight gain, cravings, and nicotine withdrawal symptoms and are socially acceptable\n      Side Effects of the patch\n      Patches may cause a local skin reaction,and insomnia with nightmares may occur.\n\n      Overdosing in nicotine is possible, especially if a person smokes while wearing the patch. Smoking while wearing a patch is dangerous and may lead to stroke or heart attack.\n      Use of the patch requires abstinence from tobacco products...i.e. no smoking or chewing tobacco.\n\n      Cost\n      Patches are expensive and cost close to $100 per month of use.\n      However bear in mind that smoking 1 ppd costs $1000 per year, which multipied by 10 years approximates the price of a car.\n      Some people are tempted to cut the patch to save money. Nicoderm is the only patch that can be cut without destroying the patch's ability to deliver nicotine through the skin to the bloodstream reliably.. It is not unsafe to cut the other patches as far as I know. However cutting the other patches impairs the transdermal drug delivery system, and may not provide reliable blood levels of nicotine. the key word here is reliable.\n\n      The total dose of nicotine in the patch does not correlate at a milligram to milligram equivalency to the dose delivered to the bloodstream. The drug delivery system of the patch ensures that nicotine is transported thru the skin at a constant rate, and e ach manufacturer uses a different patented technology to do this. Only a portion of the total nicotine contained in the patch is transported thru the skin. Individual differences in skin thickness, location of the applied patch, and other related factors play a role in the total dose delivered.\n      3 Step Tapering Method of using the patch\n          o The 21 mg patch is worn daily for 6-8 weeks for quitters who smoked an average of 1 ppd ( 2 ppd quitters may require 2 patches to alleviate cravings and withdrawal symptoms)\n          o The 14 mg patch is then worn daily for the next 2 to 4 weeks if the ex smoker remains confident in his or her ability to not smoke and if urges or cravings to smoke are controlled.\n          o The 7 mg patch is then worn for 2-4 weeks if the same criteria as above are met.\n          o In the absence of cravings and urge to smoke the patch is then stopped entirely.\n\n      It is important to individualize the tapering method . . . Some people require longer periods of use, others shorter. If cravings intensify , return to the next higher dose of the patch.\n\n      Types of nicotine patches\n            Nicotrol\n            15,10,5 mg 16 hour patches", "doctor_answer": "TRY THIS:\n\nDON\"T JOIN OR LET COME NEAR YOUR FIRST TWO FINGURES!"}

{"question": "what is the differance between psoriasis and eczima?", "patient_answer": "Psoriasis is a skin disorder,most commonly appears as thick, flaky patches on skin;patches are silvery or red. It often does not itch. It can occur at an age in both men & women but most common in 20s,30s & 40s. Commonly occurs at pressure points eg. elbows,knees,knuckles as well as scalp, trunk, arms & legs, external sex organs & less commonly it may erupt suddenly all over the body. In psoriasis, skin cells reproduce many times faster than normal & live only 3/4 days;the dead cells build up on the skin, forming thick,flaky patches. It is not an infection, & not contagious. It may be inherited; climate change, skin injury, infection, drug reaction, stress etc. can flare it up or worsen it.It is a chronic disease i.e. it can last a long time & can come back frequently.\n\nEczema is also a chronic skin disorder that causes an intensely icthy, red, raised rash; may make the skin dry & flaky. Sometimes itchy blisters form , when they burst or when scratching damage the skin, the surface may be left moist & crusty. It's not contagious. Commonest cause is general allergic over sensitivity, common in people with asthma or hay fever. Sometimes it occurs in infants.Other causes are contact with irritants like detergents, soap, engine oil etc; contact with substances which the body has become allergic to, e.g nickel jewellery, watches etc;varicose veins causing lower leg eczema.", "doctor_answer": "My mom has psorias.  It's just dry patches of flaky skin, usually on tender spots like elbows or knees.  Usually inherited.  Nobody has found a sure-fire cure for it, yet.\n\nMy brother and I have ezcima due to athsma.  It's very itchy red spots in tender, dry places like the inside of your elbow or the back of your knees.  They have many creams and gels out to cure it, though usually the only way to get rid of it is to outgrow it.  Heat irritates it, as does itchy clothing.  It's safest to wear denim and cotton with ezcima."}
{"question": "How do you get rid of the hiccups?", "patient_answer": "The best remedy for hiccups that I have ever experienced is the following maneuver: Take a glass of water. Sit down. Spread your knees out and bend forward with your head between your knees (or come down as far as you are able to). With the front of your body bent forward as much as you can, take the glass of water, raise your head up (while keeping your body bent forward) and drink the glass of water. It looks strange, but it works, every time I've ever tried it. If you have malignant hiccups....those lasting for days at a time, then go to your doctor and ask for some Thorazine. It is an anti-psychotic medication, but it works for those nasty hiccups that refuse to go away. As a nurse, I have seen Thorazine work for the most resistant hiccups.", "doctor_answer": "There are many home remedies used to treat hiccups. Most of them involve increasing the level of carbon dioxide in the blood, which usually stops hiccups. Some of these remedies include: Holding your breath and counting slowly to ten, breathing repeatedly into a paper bag for a limited period of time, quickly drinking a glass of cold water, and eating a teaspoon of sugar or honey."}
{"question": "i sometimes get a severe itching in my inner thigh area when i start to run what's the cause/remedies?", "patient_answer": "Sweating, increased blood flow, chafing maybe.  Is it cold or warm outside when you run.  If I sweat in the cold and my skin is exposed it itches.", "doctor_answer": "chafing, pure and simple. a common runner's problem, esp. long distances. Some people use Vaseline in the area BEFORE running, but there is a product called Body Glide that works great and isn't as messy. You can get it at a sports or running store. You apply it to inner thighs, etc. Wherever you're prone to chafe."}
{"question": "Home remedies for head lice.?", "patient_answer": "I don't think that there is a good home remedy. Head lice are really difficult to deal with. Here is what Dr. Weil, the alternative medicine physician, says about head lice treatment:\n\nThe conventional treatment is one percent lindane, sold as Kwell lotion. Lindane is a cousin of DDT and can harm the nervous system. Natural and safer alternatives include one percent permethrin cream rinse, sold as Nix and Neem, derived from a tree in India. Lice can develop resistance to permethrin products, and these products can aggravate asthma in some children, but both are relatively nontoxic. (Neem is sold in garden shops.)\n\nI've also heard that some California school systems are using a product called Lice-B-Gone, a non-toxic, multi-enzyme shampoo made from plant sources that seems to get rid of lice in a single application. It works by softening the glue that holds the nits (lice eggs) to the hair shaft and also dissolves the exoskeletons of adult lice. Since it contains no pesticides, Lice-B-Gone is considered safe for pregnant women, nursing mothers, young children and people with asthma.\n\nThe comb mentioned by the earlier poster is helpful.\n\nAlso, you really need to wash all pillows, sheets, towels and bedding in hot water to rid them of the lice eggs.", "doctor_answer": "Nix (permethrin 1% creme rinse). \nRid, Pronto, A-200, R&C, Triple X, or Barc (shampoos and gels with pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide). \nIf these don't work you might need a prescription medication."}

{"question": "What is the best way to lose wieght for 2006?", "patient_answer": "Don't concern yourself so much about the loss of pounds, but more about changing your food habits.

I have lost over 150 lbs. in the last few years & did not do one minute of dieting. I eat whatever I want but I keep in mind what I am eating & have trained myself to be aware of when I am full, etc. It takes awhile to make changes that will last a lifetime but, once made habit, you will be surprised at how easy it is to maintain whatever weight you wish & still not deny yourself what you want to eat.", "doctor_answer": "Go out dancing 2 times a week, 4hrs at least,like with friends at a club, just get out there and try not to sit too much.

{"question": "how many beers does it take to get drunk?", "patient_answer": "It depends on the weight of a person, and metabolism of that individual.

{"question": "How to stop a alchoholic from drinking?", "patient_answer": "Sad to say, unless you, yourself are the alcoholic, there is NOTHING you can do to stop them. It is the choice of the alky, and if you think he'll stop \"for you\" you will only be wrapped up in a very frustrating game of \"who do you trust?\" Not only is the alcoholic a liar, so is the booze. When he says \"I only drink on weekends,\" or Aren't you proud of me, I only had (X) drinks this week,\"--Watch out! When they count how many and how often, they really are deep in the grips of the disease, and fool themselves into a false feeling of \"self-control\".

{"question": "64oz a day of water is good, but how does one count other drinks?", "patient_answer": "Normally, if you drink something that is not 100% water you wouldnt count it because the ingredients will affect your metabolic system by altering your hydration/dehydration levels.  On top of that you are presurring your kidneys into more work when water just helps them.  Unless its water, dont count it.", "doctor_answer": "Easy answer - don't include other drinks."}
{"question": "why does the bird flu considered to be such a frightening disease?", "patient_answer": "The 1918, 1957 and and 1968 flu pandemics can be traced back to bird flu mutating with human virus. These pandemics killed scores of people. The panic also stems from the fact that there is no vaccine for H5N1 virus, the bird flu that is currently affecting Asia. Like last year, vaccines for \"regular\" human flu are in short supply as well.<br />\n<br />\nUnder normal circumstances, when the flu hits you're just feverish, achey and fatigued for a few days. When the flu strikes more vulnerable people, like the elderly and very young babies, it can cause respiratory problems and even kill them.", "doctor_answer": "It has been reported that the mortality rate of bird flu is about 50%.  See:\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Investigation/story?id=1130392&page=1\n\n50% mortality rate in ANY disease will cause a lot of fear.  If the bird flu were to become even more easily spread, then you're looking at perhaps millions of people dying.\n\nHowever, estimating mortality rate isn't this that straightforward.  There is some doubt whether the mortality rate is really that high.  It may be that there are many non-fatal cases that have gone undiagnosed, so that the mortality rate might be much less than 50%.\n\nFor an analysis, see:\nhttp://girlscientist.blogspot.com/2005/02/is-avian-influenza-that-deadly.html"}

{"question": "Why do i get fat by sleeping and not by eating?", "patient_answer": "Your basil metabolism is a measure of how much fuel (calories) you burn up and how much oxygen you use while at rest.  It represents almost the minimum calories you can burn just keeping your organs functioning.  At any higher level of activity you will burn more calories per hour than at rest.  Sleeping likely simulates your basil metabolism.\n\nYou can gain weight when your caloric intake is greater than what you burn off.  But it is slightly more complicated.  If you fast (or greatly reduce eating) your metabolism will automatically adjust to conserve calories; for your survival during a famine.  Also, if you sleep too much and get little exercise, your muscles may atrophy (losing some weight) while actually gaining weight from additional fat.  Bone density can be reduced very quickly for patients who must remain bedridden.  The best way to lose weight may be to walk because it uses your largest (leg) muscles keeping them in tone and healthy.  Good exercise may improve your mood and increase your metabolism long after you stop the exercise.  Most people do not eat while out on a daily walk.\n\nThe best bet may be to eat a healthy diet, get enough exercise and sleep only enough to become refreshed.  Perhaps it would be better to get too little sleep and take a nap in the afternoon to recharge your batteries.  Good luck.", "doctor_answer": "I would ask why you are sleeping so much, are you depressed?  I would talk to the dr. you might have a physical illness."}

{"question": "can you get the HIV or any other STD even if you wear a condom?", "patient_answer": "Yes.  No method of protection is 100%.  Using a condom just reduces the risk to what most people would consider an insignificant number.  Of course having sex with someone you KNOW has HIV or a STD is a very risky behavior even if you wear a condom.", "doctor_answer": "Yes, condoms only reduce the chance of receiving an STD. Although the chance of getting one is unlikely there is still the chance that it might happen. As condoms do not protect against oral sex on females."}
{"question": "What does it mean when a person has gaps in their memory?", "patient_answer": "If you are speaking about actual \"gaps\" where you cannot remember things from a point in time, or you suddenly are somewhere and cannot remember how you got there, you need to speak to a professional counselor, especially if under the age of 40.\n\nIf you are talking about gaps in early childhood, that could be \"normal\" for you, depends on if it is truly gaps or no memories before age 3 or 4.\n\nIf you are talking about over age 40 and symptomology similar to more forgetfulness, then you need a medical doctor. \n\nThere are many reasons and causes for this.", "doctor_answer": "It could be reason for concern (e.g. age issues, medications, and so on).

{"question": "Taste and smell, what is the connection?", "patient_answer": "Smell and taste problems can have a big impact on our lives. Because these senses contribute substantially to our enjoyment of life, our desire to eat, and be social, smell and taste disorders can be serious. When smell and taste are impaired, life loses some zest. We eat poorly, socialize less, and as a result, feel worse. Many older people experience this problem. \n\nSmell and taste also warn us about dangers, such as fire, poisonous fumes, and spoiled food. Certain jobs require that these senses be accurate-chefs and firemen rely on taste and smell. One study estimates that more than 200,000 people visit a doctor with smell and taste disorders every year, but many more cases go unreported.\n\nLoss of the sense of smell may be a sign of sinus disease, growths in the nasal passages, or, in rare circumstances, brain tumors", "doctor_answer": "We can only taste 5 things with our taste buds: bitter, salty, sour, sweet, and umami. Most of what we \"taste\" is actually derived from smelling. This is why when our nose is stuffed up, food doesn't taste as well."}

Nonsurgical treatment includes either regular observation by a doctor about every 4 to 6 months to check for any curve progression or the use of a brace to stop a spinal curve from getting worse. If the curve is over 40 degrees, bracing may not be effective, and surgery may be considered because a curve this large is likely to progress.

Someone can look and feel perfectly healthy and still be infected. In fact, an estimated one-third of those who are HIV positive do not know it. Neither do their sex partners. \n\nWhen HIV enters the bloodstream, it begins to attack certain white blood cells called T4 lymphocyte cells (helper cells). The immune system then produces antibodies to fight off the infection. Therefore, the presence of antibodies to HIV result from HIV infection. Testing can tell you whether or not you have developed antibodies to HIV. \n\n\n\nThe tests commonly used to detect HIV infection actually look for antibodies produced by your body to fight HIV. Most people will develop detectable antibodies within 3 months after infection, the average being 20 days.During the time between exposure and the test, it is important to avoid any behavior that might result in exposure to blood, semen, or vaginal secretions.\n\n\n\nTake the test. Here i give you a link to see where you can take it depending the place where you live.", "doctor_answer": "Ignore the comment about hiv being dormant for up to four years - that has no impact on how soon antibodies appear, which is generally witin a few weeks of exposure, and within 6 months for 99% of people exposed.\n\nIf you want to be sure you are negative sooner than the 6 month window that HIV antibody testing requires for certainty, then you can get a PCR-RNA viral load test done instead.  This is a very sensitive test that will be 99% accurate within 4 weeks of exposrue, and 90% accurate within 2 weeks of exposure.  It directly measures viral RNA instead of antibodies.  It costs a lot more - usualy around 200 to 300 dollars, but you will know your status much much sooner."}

Your doctor may prescribe bed rest, or advise you to maintain a low, painless activity level for a few days to several weeks. This helps the spinal nerve inflammation to decrease.  herniated disc is frequently treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication if the pain is only mild to moderate. An epidural steroid injection may be performed utilizing a spinal needle under x-ray guidance to direct the medication to the exact level of the disc herniation. Your doctor may recommend physical therapy. Therapy may include pelvic traction, gentle massage, ice and heat therapy, ultrasound, electrical muscle stimulation, and stretching exercises. Pain medication and muscle relaxants may also be beneficial in conjunction with the physical therapy. If these conservative measures do not help, then usually surgery is indicated.", "doctor_answer": "go to a chiropractor"}

Since hives are usually caused by an allergy, you should try to figure out what it is that you are allergic to so that you can eliminate this.

That should be considered temporary, as if you have chronic hives you should really see a doctor.", "doctor_answer": "As pp said hives can be due to an allergy.  I had hives for 3 months from Amoxicillin per the doctor - but I think it was from a combo of antibiotics I was on for sinus problems and UTIs, and another infection (like antibiotic overload).  There can be immune system problems too.  I had them really bad then they turned into (I think it's called - ) dermatography (\"skin writing\").  I went to an Allergist and had tons of tests done.

Ice can help inflamation.", "doctor_answer": "You should try going to a chiropractor for your problems.  Whiplash causes injuries to your spine which protects your spinal cord and all the nerves coming out of it.  You are probably suffering from nerve impingement syndrome, which is when a spinal bone gets out of place and puts pressure on your nerves coming out of the spinal column.  This pressure can cause muscle spasms, pain, weakness or even numbness into the arms or legs.  I work for a chiropractor who has treated a lot of patients with similar injuries from car accidents and they have received tremendous relief with their pains from chiropractic care.  Also, you should look into a new technology in chiropractic called the Pro-Adjuster.  It takes the twisting, popping, and cracking out of chiropractic adjustments.

{"question": "ganglion cyst?", "patient_answer": "A ganglion cyst is a swelling that often appears on or around joints and tendons in the hand (or sometime feet). The size of the cyst can vary over time, often becoming more inflamed if irritated. It is most frequently located around the wrist and on the fingers.\n\nThe exact cause of the formation of ganglion cysts is still unknown. They occur more often in the 20 - 40 age group and in females.\n\nThey are not generally considered harmful although can cause discomfort and/or limit movement. Frequently, the cysts will disappear over time, so in cases of small cysts that don't cause symptoms, no therapy is necessary. If a ganglion cyst is symptomatic, it can be managed by aspiration or surgery. Aspiration of the cyst is the simpler method, but cysts will develop again in about 50% cases. Recurrence rate after surgery is only 5-10%, the procedure is simple and usually there are no complications.", "doctor_answer": "From my own experience,  It is from reputition, usually on the wrist area , a lump, filled with a fluid, feels hard  it will go away by itself in time."}

(Source: Young Again and others)\n# Rapeseed is a lubricating oil used by small industry. It has never been meant for human consumption.\n# It is derived from the mustard family and is considered a toxic and poisonous weed, which when processed, becomes rancid very quickly.\n# It has been shown to cause lung cancer (Wall Street Journal: 6/7/95)\n# It is very inexpensive to grow and harvest. Insects won't eat it.\n# Some typical and possible side effects include loss of vision, disruption of the central nervous system, respiratory illness, anemia, constipation, increased incidence of heart disease and cancer, low birth weights in infants and irritability.\n# Generally rapeseed has a cumulative effect, taking almost 10 years before symptoms begin to manifest. It has a tendency to inhibit proper metabolism of foods and prohibits normal enzyme function. Canola is a Trans Fatty Acid, which has shown to have a direct link to cancer. These Trans Fatty acids are labeled as hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils. Avoid all of them!\n# According to John Thomas' book, Young Again, 12 years ago in England and Europe, rape seed was fed to cows, pigs and sheep who later went blind and began attacking people.

{"question": "What are some symptoms to Manic Depression?", "patient_answer": "Bipolar Disorder (Manic Depression) \n\nAnother type of depression is bipolar disorder, which was formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression. This condition shows a particular pattern of inheritance. Not nearly as common as the other types of depressive disorders, bipolar disorder involves cycles of depression and mania, or elation. Bipolar disorder is often a chronic, recurring condition. Sometimes, the mood switches are dramatic and rapid, but most often they are gradual.\n\nWhen in the depressed cycle, the person can experience any or all of the symptoms of a depressive disorder. When in the manic cycle, any or all of the symptoms listed under mania may be experienced. Mania often affects thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that cause serious problems and embarrassment. For example, unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is in a manic phase.\n\nA significant variant of bipolar disorder is designated as bipolar II. (The usual form of bipolar disorder is referred to as bipolar I.) Bipolar II is a syndrome in which the affected person has repeated depressive episodes punctuated by what is called hypomania (mini-highs). These euphoric states in bipolar II do not fully meet the criteria for the complete manic episodes that occur in bipolar I. \n\nDepression Symptoms of Manic Depression\n\nPersistently sad, anxious, or \"empty\" mood. \nFeelings of hopelessness, pessimism. \nFeelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness. \nLoss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed, including sex. \nInsomnia, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping. \nDecreased appetite and/or weight loss, or overeating and weight gain. \nFatigue, decreased energy, being \"slowed down.\" \nThoughts of death or suicide, suicide attempts. \nRestlessness, irritability. \nDifficulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions. \nPersistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders, and chronic pain.\nMania Symptoms of Manic Depression\n\nInappropriate elation. \nInappropriate irritability. \nSevere insomnia. \nGrandiose notions. \nIncreased talking speed and/or volume. \nDisconnected and racing thoughts. \nIncreased sexual desire. \nMarkedly increased energy. \nPoor judgment. \nInappropriate social behavior.", "doctor_answer": "Bipolar disorder, or manic-depressive illness.

{"question": "where do herpes come from?", "patient_answer": "The herpes infection has a history dating back to ancient Greece.  The word 'herpes' was used by Hippocrates to describe lesions that 'creep' or 'crawl.'  Although previously well characterized, it was not until 1893 that the transmissibility was recognized.6\n\nThe herpes family of viruses currently is thought to consist of herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex 2 (HSV-2), varicella-zoster, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, and human herpes virus VI, VII, and VIII.5  All are capable of entering and replicating in epithelial cells, while some of the herpes family is neurotropic and others are lymphotropic.  HSV-1 and HSV-2 are neurotropic, infecting sensory nerve fibers and have been demonstrated to reproduce in epithelial cells.  HSV-1 and HSV-2 are lytic to human epithelial cells and latent in neural tissue at the site of regional ganglions.  Usually the virus initially enters the body through a break in the mucous membrane integrity, although there is evidence that it may penetrate intact skin.  In either case, transmission results from mucocutaneous contact with infected secretions and aerosols.  When reactivated, the virus travels along the nerve axon to the surface epithelial cells and can cause a recurrent epithelial outbreak.\n\n\nhttp://www.thejcdp.com/issue009/tilliss/10tillis.htm", "doctor_answer": "Herpes is a virus, which is the reason that, unlike love, herpes is forever."}

That is, a person who has genital herpes has the potential to always be shedding active virus. \n\nBut keep in mind that everyone is different-- all bodies and immune systems are different, and the longer you're infected, the less common any such outbreaks will occur.

{"question": "how much water you drink per day?", "patient_answer": "How much water should you drink each day? — a simple question with no easy answer. Just as you are unique, so are your water needs. And how much water you need depends on many factors, including your health status, how active you are and where you live.\n\nThough no single formula fits all people, several guidelines are available to help you estimate how much to drink each day. Delve into your daily fluid needs to learn how your body uses water and what factors may increase — or decrease — your water requirements.\n\n\nHealth benefits of water\n\nWater is crucial to your health. It makes up, on average, 60 percent of your body weight. Every system in your body depends on water.\n\n\n\nLack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry on normal functions. Even mild dehydration — as little as a 1 percent to 2 percent loss of your body weight — can sap your energy and make you tired. Dehydration poses a particular health risk for the very young and the very old. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include:\n\nExcessive thirst \nFatigue \nHeadache \nDry mouth \nLittle or no urination \nMuscle weakness \nDizziness \nLightheadedness \n\nHow much water do you need?\n\nEvery day you lose water through sweating — noticeable and unnoticeable — exhaling, urinating and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you need to replace this water by consuming beverages and foods that contain water. So how much water, or more precisely fluid, do you need?\n\nThis isn't an easy question to answer. A healthy adult's daily fluid intake can vary widely. Most people drink fluid to quench thirst, to supply perceived water needs and \"out of habit.\" At least three approaches estimate total fluid (water) needs for healthy, sedentary adults living in a temperate climate.\n\nReplacement approach. The average urine output for adults is 1.5 liters a day. You lose close to an additional liter of water a day through breathing, sweating and bowel movements. Food usually accounts for 20 percent of your fluid intake, so you if you consume 2 liters of water or other beverages a day (a little more than 8 cups), along with your normal diet, you can replace the lost fluids. \nEight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Another approach to water intake is the \"8 x 8 rule\" — drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day (about 1.9 liters). The rule could also be stated, \"drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day,\" as all fluids count toward the daily total. Though this approach isn't supported by scientific evidence, many people use this basic rule as a guideline for how much water and other fluids to drink. \nDietary recommendations. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day and women consume 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages a day. These guidelines are based on national food surveys that assessed people's average fluid intakes. \nYou can choose any of these fluid intake approaches to gauge your fluid needs. But your current total fluid intake is probably OK if you drink enough water to quench your thirst, produce a colorless or slightly yellow normal amount of urine, and feel well.\n\n\nFactors that influence water needs\n\nYou may need to modify total fluid intake from these recommended amounts depending on several factors, including how active you are, the climate, your health status, and if you're pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\nExercise. If you exercise or engage in any activity that makes you sweat, you'll need to drink extra water to compensate for that fluid loss. Drink 2 cups of water two hours before a long endurance event, for example, a marathon or half-marathon. One to 2 cups of water is also adequate for shorter bouts of exercise. During the activity, replenish fluids at regular intervals, and continue drinking water or other fluids after you&", "doctor_answer": "About 1.5 to 2litres per day is required in the form of fluids.

{"question": "What is the most successful treatment for Peyronies Disease?", "patient_answer": "Medications:\n\nOver the years, a wide variety of medications have been used to treat Peyronie’s disease. Some patients have benefitted, while others have found their medications seemed to make little difference. This variation in treatment outcome and the resulting lack of consensus regarding the drug(s) of choice reflects in part an uncertainty with strategy. While doctors can’t say with precision what causes the disorder in each individual case, there does seem to be a common disease-producing process in all men. Yet where, in this complex spectrum extending from early wound healing to late scar formation, do we intervene with medications? This question remains a topic of clinical research. \n\nIn general, changes in tissue elasticity that accompany the inflammation of early Peyronie’s disease are reversible, whereas the loss of elasticity associated with the end-stage scarring characteristic of the later illness is not. Since it is a consequence of local change in elasticity, bending responds best to medical therapy in the early stage, a period that generally lasts about six months. \n\nIn order to evaluate medical treatments, we should know how a case of Peyronie’s disease evolves on its own, in the absence of therapy. Understanding this so-called natural history of the disease provides a basis for comparison, and a means for deciding when surgical intervention may be appropriate. During the intial six months of the disorder, erections can be painful. Eventually, even in the absence of treatment, the pain usually goes away. Unfortunately, bending does not always follow the same pattern. Though it may improve or resolve spontaneously in a minority of men, most untreated men with Peyronie’s disease will retain some degree of penile distortion. Most medical treatments have a success rate of about 60% in improving bending. Some factors associated with a tendency for bending to persist are: the presence of dupuytren’s contractures, the presence of heavy plaque calcification, and the presence of severe (greater than 45 degrees) curvature.\n\nSome of the contemporary medications in use are: \n\nVITAMIN E: this anti-oxidant has other uses in the treatment of scars, and has been employed in the treatment of Peyronie’s disease since 1945. \nPOTABA or potassium para amino benzoate is designated by the FDA as \"possibly effective\". Large doses are required, which may cause intestinal upset. \nCOLCHICINE is a medication used for many years in the treatment of gout. It acts against inflammation, and interferes with the manufacture of scar tissue. \nVERAPAMIL is usually given by direct injection into the plaque. It also interferes with the synthesis of scar tissue precursors. \nCOLLAGENASE is an investigational drug that enzymatically digests scar. \nSurgical Treatment:\n\nWho should consider an operation?\n\nCandidates for surgery should fufill four basic criteria. First and foremost is severity. The risks and expense of an operation only make sense when bending or deformity is severe enough to seriously interfere with sexual function. Secondly, natural healing or spontaneous resolution should have been given an opportunity. This is usually accomplished by deferring the decision for surgery at least twelve months from the time of onset. During this time the third criteria can be satisfied - an adequete trial of some form of medical therapy. Finally, no operation should be done on a man whose condition is changing, either for the better or worse. The best surgical outcomes are in men with stable (unchanging) condition.\n\nWhat are the risks of surgery?\n\nUnfortunately, surgery does not offer a cure for Peyronie’s disease. The scarring in men with deformity severe and persistant enough to warrant an operation represents an irreversible loss of connective tissue elasticity. Though surgical restoration of sexual function can be both effective and reliable, potential candidates need to understand the compromise inh", "doctor_answer": "Treatment: \nI. a). Mild Curvature with good erections - no treatment is needed unless the patient insists on cosmetic improvement. This is handled by (1) making the long side shorter, with a series of plication sutures or, (2) making the short side longer by incising the plaque transversely. Usually nothing further is needed; a tissue graft is rarely necessary. \n\nI. b). Mild curvature with poor erections - The erectile dysfunction is the chief problem here and can be treated by the intra-urethral pellet, Muse; Viagra; or a penile prosthesis. Intracavernosal self-injection theoretically could make the curvature worse, so I prefer to avoid it. Experience suggests that in these patients erectile dysfunction often worsens faster than might otherwise be expected. The penile prosthesis is an attractive option in these cases. \n\nII. a). Moderate to severe curvature with good erections - here the curvature is the problem. This is treated by making the short side longer or the long side shorter. The latter tends to shorten the penis, and patients do not happily accept a shorter penis. Therefore, the short side is made longer by exposing the plaque and making a series of short elliptical transverse incisions through the plaque down to, but not into, the spongy tissue, making the plaque discontinuous - dividing it into disconnected segments - allows the penis to expand symmetrically on erection. To do this it may be necessary to elevate the neurovascular bundle. Temporary, patchy sensory loss may occur postoperatively but I have never seen it permanent, or even last longer than 3 months. \n\nII. b). Moderate to severe curvature with poor erections - the penile prosthesis has been very successful with these patients. Just by inflating the prosthesis alone, adequate straightening may occur. Often inflating the prosthesis by manually \"molding\" the penis gently but firmly bending it opposite the curve - additional straightening can nearly always be obtained. If still more straightening is needed, an incision is made and the plaque exposed and incised or excised. \n\nIn those patients whose disease has left them with unacceptable shortening, we have obtained highly satisfactory results by combining the above procedures with a lengthening procedure. Significant length gain can be obtained in this manner. \n\nPatients can go home the same day or the next day. Intercourse can take place in 6 weeks. Complications can include bleeding, infection, numbness, shortening, inadequate curvature correction, discomfort lasting more than a few days. We have never seen permanent sensory loss, worsening of erections, or ejaculatory problems. \n\nIt is important for patients to understand that while penile curvature can be markedly improved and erectile function restored, once the patient has Peyronie's disease, his penis will never be the same as before the disease developed."}

These symptoms are unexplained infections (due to fewer white blood cells), unexpected bleeding (due to fewer platelets) and fatigue (due to fewer red blood cells).\n\n\nTo confirm a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, a physician examines a blood sample and determines the number of each type of blood cell circulating in the blood. Aplastic anemia is strongly suspected when two or three of the cell counts are extremely low. A definitive diagnosis is made if a marrow sample (a biopsy) shows a great reduction in the number of cells in the marrow itself."}
{"question": "How do u get a cold sore?", "patient_answer": "it is contracted through direct skin contact (not necessarily in the genital area) with an infected person. The virus travels through tiny breaks in the skin or through moist areas, but symptoms may not appear for up to a month or more after infection. Transmission was thought to be most common during an active outbreak, however in the early 1980s scientists and doctors realized that the virus can be shed from the skin in the absence of symptoms. It is estimated that between 50 and 80% of new HSV-2 cases are from asymptomatic viral shedding.\n\nHSV asymptomatic shedding is believed to occur on 2.9% of days while on antiviral therapy, versus 10.8% of days without. Shedding is known to be more frequent within the first 12 months of acquiring HSV-2. There are some indications that some individuals may have much lower patterns of shedding, but evidence supporting this is not fully supported. Sex should always be avoided in the presence of symptomic lesions.\n\nWomen are more susceptible to acquiring genital HSV-2 than men. On an annual basis, without the use of antivirals or condoms, the transmission risk from infected male to female is approximately 8-10%. This is believed to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites. Transmission risk from infected female to male is approximately 4-5% annually. Supressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios by about 50%, meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom free. Condom use also reduces the transmission risk by 50%. Condom use is much more effective at preventing male to female transmission than vice-versa. (Wald et al., 2001) The effects of combining antiviral and condom use is roughly additive, thus resulting in approximately a 75% combined reduction in annual transmission risk. It is important to note that these figures reflect experiences with subjects having frequently recurring genital herpes (>6 recurrences per year), subjects with low recurrence rates and those with no clinical manifestations were excluded from these studies.", "doctor_answer": "You get a cold sore when you don't drink enough water, and you get cut, or bite yourself in your mouth.

{"question": "What causes an Itch?", "patient_answer": "The average human body is covered by about 20 square feet (2 square meters) of skin. Skin is the only organ that is constantly exposed to potential irritation. And, with so many things coming into contact with your skin daily, you're bound to get an itch or two. Serious itching can be caused by allergies, disease, emotions and infections, but let's take a look at what causes the common itches that aggravate you everyday. \nItching, also known as pruritus, starts with some kind of external stimuli, including bugs, dust, clothing fibers and hair. Like tickling, itching is a built-in defense mechanism that alerts your body to the potential of being harmed. In this case, it might be the potential of being bit by a bug. \n\nWhen the stimuli lands on your skin, it may not bother you at first, but soon it will begin to rub back and forth across your skin. Once the hair or dust scratches your skin's surface layer, receptors in the dermis of the skin will become irritated. In a split second, these receptors send a signal through fibers in the skin to your spinal cord and then up to the cerebral cortex in your brain. \n\nThe same fibers that send itching signals are also used to send pain signals to the brain, which once led some scientists to believe that itching was a form of light pain. That notion has since been dispelled by research, which showed that pain and itching elicit opposite responses. Pain causes us to withdraw and itching causes us to scratch. \n\nAs soon as we feel an itch, our first natural response is to scratch the spot of the itch with our fingernails. The reason for this response is simple -- we want to remove the irritant as soon as possible. Once you've scratched the area of irritation, you are likely to feel some relief. When your brain realizes that you've scratched away the irritant, the signal being sent to your brain that you have an itch is interrupted and therefore no longer recognized by the brain. \n\nEven if you don't remove the irritant, scratching will at least cause pain and divert your attention away from the itching. The irritant that caused the itching is very small, maybe only a few microns in length, so it disturbs only a few nerve endings. When you use your fingernail to scratch the spot where the irritant is, you not only remove the irritant but you irritate a lot more nerve endings than the irritant.", "doctor_answer": "huh! i thought it was the release of histamine by the injured cells.how silly of me."}

{"question": "What are the symptoms and causes of blood infections?", "patient_answer": "Sepsis (or blood infection) is a condition in which your body is fighting a severe infection. If you become \"septic,\" you will likely be in a state of low blood pressure termed \"shock.\" This condition can develop either as a result of your body’s own defense system or from toxic substances made by the infecting agent (such as a bacteria, virus, or fungus).\n\n    * People at risk\n\n          o People whose immune systems (the body’s defense against microbes) are not functioning well because of an illness, such as cancer or AIDS, are more prone to have sepsis.\n\n          o Because their immune systems are not completely developed, very young babies may get sepsis if they become infected and are not treated in a timely manner. Often, if they develop signs of an infection such as fever, infants have to receive antibiotics and be admitted to the hospital.\n\n          o The elderly population, especially those with other medical illnesses such as diabetes, may be at increased risk as well.\n\nMany different microbes can cause sepsis. Although bacteria are most commonly the cause, viruses and fungi can also cause sepsis. Infections in the lungs (pneumonia), bladder and kidneys (urinary tract infections), skin (cellulitis), abdomen (such as appendicitis), and other organs (such as meningitis) can spread and lead to sepsis. Infections that develop after surgery can also lead to sepsis.\n\nSepsis Symptoms\n\n    * If you have sepsis, often you will have fever. Sometimes, though, the body temperature may be normal or even low.\n\n    * You may also have chills and severe shaking.\n\n    * Your heart may be beating very fast and your breathing rapid.\n\n    * Confusion, disorientation, and agitation may be seen as well as dizziness and decreased urination.\n\n    * Some people who have sepsis develop a rash on their skin. The rash may be a reddish discoloration or small dark red dots throughout the body.\n\n    * You may also develop pain in the joints at your wrists, elbows, back, hips, knees, and ankles.", "doctor_answer": "Yahoo Health should be able to explain this better than me.

{"question": "I read once that a small subset of eastern europeans have an immunity to AIDS, is this true?", "patient_answer": "The University of Washington has a really good program on UW TV by Mary-Claire King, in genome sciences, that discusses this issue.  There are certain co-receptors located on the surface of CD4 T-cells that some people are lacking that may make them more resistant to HIV infection. There is a CCR5 receptor and some people lack 1 allele while others lack 2 alleles for this corecptor (the latter is called delta 32 mutation).\n\nResearch laboratories can determine whether you have the mutation, but not enough is known yet to understand the meaning of the mutation (lack of CCR5).\n\nThe Univeristy of Wahington and other research centers are doing studies in HIV serodisconcordant couples (1 person is HIV+ and the other HIV-) and other high risk groups to determine why some people who have been repeatedly exposed to HIV do not become infected.

{"question": "What is the best cure for fibromyalgia?", "patient_answer": "I have had fibromyalgia for over 10 years and when I first got it, I felt pretty much how you described.  \n\nIt took me years of research and application to find what works best for me.  Every person is individual, so you will have to go by trial and error, but here is some of what I do...\n\n1. Take an antidepressant. I've tried many prescribed by my doctor and found that even St.John's Wort works very well.  The antidepressants raise your seretonin levels, (the feel good chemical in your brain,) and you just generally feel better all over.\n\n2. Get some exercise every day. Not too little, but not too much.  Too little will allow your muscles to become stiff and sore but too much will make them ache like crazy.  I find yoga and walking to be the two best exercises for me. I do them every day and my body feels 1000% better.\n\n3. Eat a healthier diet.  Too much sugar, white flour, fat and carbs, seem to exasperate the condition.  Try to stick to natural foods, whole grains, fresh fruit and vegetables.\n\n4. Get enough sleep and rest.  Try to get 8 hours of sleep each night if possible. If you have what I do, and wake up each night and toss and turn, try taking a herbal sleep remedy.  Valerian and passionflower worked very well for me. They sell sleep remedy blends in health food stores and I find they really help. \n\n5.  Mediation and relaxation...even if it's only for 5 minutes a day, will make a big difference.  I know you said you have 4 children, and I have 5, all boys, so I know it's really hard to get any time to meditate or relax, but it's really, really, important if you are going to be any good to them.  You have to take care of yourself.\n\n6. Journalling. Again, I know this takes time, but it is the best way to get your feelings out of you.  If you don't have someone you can share you feeling with, then write about them.  Holding all your feelings inside causes a lot of tension, and I believe that's where and how Fibromyalgia starts.  Once I started writing, and crying, releasing some of my pain and withheld emotions, I really started feeling better.\n\nI wish you all the best of luck. You are living with a difficult chronic condition.  Take good care of yourself.  That's always the best place to start.\n\nTake care.\n\nKathy", "doctor_answer": "In my experience pain medications do not work. My best advise is make sure to get plenty of sleep, take a multiple vitamin, keep active in at least low impact sports, and consider Magnesium and Malic Acid supplements (consult the doctor or a nutritionist to have your Magnesuim level checked- it is a simpe mouth swab and not painful), meditation does help some in keeping the pain back if you can seperate your mind from the pain, and try to take 2-3 warm Epson Salt baths a week (Epson salt contains Magnesium and soaking in a warm tub of it helps to get the mineral into the body. Magnesium aids the muscles in using oxygen and when the level is low which is typical in Fibro it can cause are cramps, spasms, and pain.) Also, Fibromyalgia is a neurotransmitter disorder certain foods can trigger similiar symptoms to Fibro. Try eliminating Monsodium Glutamate from your diet. I did and some of my symptoms (chronic headaches and nausea) went away. It is in everything from Doritos to chicken soup. A few key finding's of an FDA study found MSG to cause a \"burning sensation in the back of the neck, forearms and chest\".\nIt's not a wonder that you are having problems concentrating, stress, and anxiety. Whey the body is in pain the brain kicks into fight of flight mode. This increases the tension in your body (read muscles) which increases your pain and continues the wonderful circle of Fibro. Otherwise, learn your limits and pace yourself.\nGood luck!"}

{"question": "what causes kidney stones, my son in law has 6 now and in terrible pain ...?", "patient_answer": "Doctors do not always know what causes a stone to form. While certain foods may promote stone formation in people who are susceptible, scientists do not believe that eating any specific food causes stones to form in people who are not susceptible.\n\nA person with a family history of kidney stones may be more likely to develop stones. Urinary tract infections, kidney disorders such as cystic kidney diseases, and certain metabolic disorders such as hyperparathyroidism are also linked to stone formation.\n\nIn addition, more than 70 percent of people with a rare hereditary disease called renal tubular acidosis develop kidney stones.\n\nCystinuria and hyperoxaluria are two other rare, inherited metabolic disorders that often cause kidney stones. In cystinuria, too much of the amino acid cystine, which does not dissolve in urine, is voided. This can lead to the formation of stones made of cystine. In patients with hyperoxaluria, the body produces too much of the salt oxalate. When there is more oxalate than can be dissolved in the urine, the crystals settle out and form stones.\n\n \nShapes of various stones. Sizes are usually smaller than shown here.\n \nHypercalciuria is inherited. It is the cause of stones in more than half of patients. Calcium is absorbed from food in excess and is lost into the urine. This high level of calcium in the urine causes crystals of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate to form in the kidneys or urinary tract.\n\nOther causes of kidney stones are hyperuricosuria which is a disorder of uric acid metabolism, gout, excess intake of vitamin D, urinary tract infections, and blockage of the urinary tract. Certain diuretics which are commonly called water pills or calcium-based antacids may increase the risk of forming kidney stones by increasing the amount of calcium in the urine.\n\nCalcium oxalate stones may also form in people who have a chronic inflammation of the bowel or who have had an intestinal bypass operation, or ostomy surgery. As mentioned above, struvite stones can form in people who have had a urinary tract infection. People who take the protease inhibitor indinavir, a drug used to treat HIV infection, are at risk of developing kidney stones.", "doctor_answer": "salty foods"}

{"question": "why do some people get addicted to drugs and some don't?", "patient_answer": "Addiction to drugs and alcohol tends to run in families and may have to do with how the brain processes certain chemicals, particularly those of the \"feel good\" type, which may be lacking or dormant in the addict until they are activated by  drugs or alcohol.  \n\nAccording to Carl Jung, alcoholic drinking is seen as a reflection of the human need,gone wrong, for a spiritual life. In a famous letter to Bill Wilson, Jung wrote that the craving for alcohol is the equivalent, on a low level, of the spiritual thirst of our being for wholeness, or union with God. Jung\nnotes that in the word alcohol in Latin is spiritus, a word that describes the highest religious experience, as well as the most depraving poison. In solving the problem of alcoholism, Jung offered the formula spiritus contra spiritum. A figurative translation of this Latin formular is, \"it takes the Spirit of God to overcome the harmful spirit of alcohol.”", "doctor_answer": "Some people have an addictive personality.

{"question": "Does anyone have a good way to lose weight fast and i have more then 30 lbs to lose?", "patient_answer": "I would take the advice of the first two people, but unhealthy ways to lose weight quickly are:\n\nWrestlers Diet:  Drink lots of orange juice, and only eat one small meal a day, like a sandwich and an apple.\n\nStarvation:  Although I have been told this actually causes the body to store fat because it thinks you are dying.\n\nAnorexia:  Probably the most dangerous and quickest way to lose weight.  People eat mostly what they want, and very soon after, vomit it back up, so the body never has a chance to process your food.\n\n*all of these techniques are dangerous, and Im sure any doctor would be mad at me for even offering these options, but I think it is your right to know whats out there.  Good Luck!", "doctor_answer": "Don't use pills or starve yourself. Pills harm your body and not eating teaches your body it has to store EVERYTHING you eat, so it becomes even harder to lose weight later.\n\nThe one diet I have seen people lose this kind of weight on consistently is Atkins. It really works. You don't have to eat less, just change the foods you eat. And NO, Atkins is NOT an all protein diet like some people say. Get the book from the library and read the chapter about the induction diet. That will get you through the first 2 weeks, and should let you lose 10 pounds or more.\n\nAfter that, read the part on the maintenence diet so you can learn how to adjust your diet so you have more freedom about what you eat, but keep the weight off. This is the mistake most people make. They don't read it.\n\nRemember, if you change your diet, and lose weight, and then change your diet back to what it was originally... your weight will go back to what it was originally too. A diet is a lifestyle change, not a \"cure\".\n\nI know you can do it!"}

The recovery was a full year before I had complete strength and could work out fully again.", "doctor_answer": "as a small baby, yes, if it's stabilized quickly enough. fully grown human lungs, though, take much longer to heal. you'll get close to perfect OVER TIME."}

{"question": "do  you know if there is any cure for Marburg virus,or a knownh vaccine, or medacation to lessen the symptoms?", "patient_answer": "As with other hemorrhagic fever viruses, the treatment options for Marburg are limited. Hypotension and shock may require early administration of vasopressors and hemodynamic monitoring with attention to fluid and electrolyte balance, circulatory volume, and blood pressure. Viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) patients tend to respond poorly to fluid infusions and rapidly develop pulmonary edema.\n\nPatient caregivers require barrier infection control measures including double gloves, impermeable gowns, face shields, eye protection, and leg and shoe coverings.\n\nA few research groups are working on drugs and vaccines to fight the virus. In 2002, Genphar, a company doing research for the United States Army's biodefense program, announced that an experimental vaccine protected animals from a high dose of Marburg virus. The tests were conducted by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). According to the company, all animals in the control group died within days whereas all animals that received the regular dosage of the vaccine were fully protected. The company has moved on to non-human primate trials. [4] Late in 2003, the US government awarded the company a contract worth $8.4 million for what was described as \"a multivalent Ebola, Marburg filovirus vaccine program\".\n\nIn June 2005 scientists at Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory announced that they had also developed vaccines for both Marburg and Ebola that showed significant promise in primate testing. Studies on mice also suggested that the vaccine might be an effective treatment for the disease if it is administered shortly after a patient is infected. To make the vaccines the scientists fused a surface protein from the viruses they hope to protect against onto an animal virus - vesicular stomatitis - which is thought to be of no threat to humans.

{"question": "what's the best way to lost weight and how am i gonna maintain it.?", "patient_answer": "I have always battled weight gain but when I was modeling I couldn't afford to put on a few extra pounds, and I hated \"exercising\" and I love eating! The only way I could effectively keep my weight down was to find way that I really enjoyed that would burn off those calories. My friend turned me on to boxing. Not kick boxing aerobics (not that theres anything wrong with that) but it was training with a real boxing trainer. Three times a week I would go into the gym for an hour and half and cover my self in abaleen (makes you sweat more) and then put on a sauna suit and get in the ring. He would hold mits and make me punch until my arms could punch anymore. He would put me through the same kind of training as he would if I was training to really fight. (Even though I have no intention of ever doing that) We would weigh in at the beginning of every work out and then again at the end and on average you left about 1 to 2 pounds lighter from sweating so much. It was an amazing stress releaser, and very cool from a self defense aspect as well. sorry to get off on a tangent about boxing as boxing isn't for everyone but my point was find a way to work out that you enjoy and that doesn't feel like a chore. And you'll have no problem maintaining.", "doctor_answer": "Diet and excericise. Try not to eat 4 hours before going to bed. If absolutely have to, eat a fruit or a vegetable. Do cardio workouts 3 times a week for at least 45 minutes."}

You can also check with your state medical board to see if there are any complaints against the doctor as well.  At the present time I am unaware of any national database so if you don't find any problems local and he/she has been in the state for a period of time your probably ok.

{"question": "Without having biopsy how would i konw if a lump on my left breast is malignant?", "patient_answer": "If something is found on a mammogram, they will usually do an ultrasound and/or MRI to rule out cancer. While these tests can't determine if it's cancer for sure, they can and do show some lumps to be non-cancerous, which will prevent some unnecessary biopsies.  If the tests don't rule out cancer, then a biopsy is the only way to know for sure what it is.\n\nFollow your doctor's advice, and good luck with everything.", "doctor_answer": "To my knowledge, that's the only way they can test it to find what it's made of. X-rays, ultrasounds and mammagrams only show that there's something there. If you have a lump, don't mess around...get it tested. Finding out now could save your life! More gals are living through breast cancer now than ever before and it's all because of early detection. I personally know several women who have had the treatments and are cancer free. It just might be nothing. Knowing is better than worrying. <*)))><"}

{"question": "What is the scientific basis for energy healing? I'm looking for an explanation, not an empirical study.?", "patient_answer": "Well, if you are looking for a scientific basis, you aren't going to find one.  In the fields of pseudoscience/New Age quackery, the term \"energy\" is used as a substitute for \"magic\".  \n\nhttp://skepdic.com/energy.html", "doctor_answer": "As far as I know, energy healing is considered an alternative healing method based on the manipulation of the Qi (chi or chee).  Normally a person is surrounded by a field of energy, which is sometimes seen as an Aura of color.  It is an ancient method fromt the Orient that has gained popularity in the recent years. As of yet, there is no scientific proof, but there are a lot of theories on how this works.\n\nThe links below can provide more information on some aspects of energy healing.

{"question": "I've heard a pound of fat is equivalent to 3500 (or 2500 Calories)? which is it and is it that simple?", "patient_answer": "It's 3500 calories.  And no it's not that simple as some will lead you to believe.  \n\nYou don't mention anything about your diet so I don't actually know how many calories you're consuming on a daily basis (or what foods).  The main idea is to maintain a calorie deficit so if you're not losing weight, chances are you're consuming more than your expending.\n\nMake sure you make wise food decisions:\nhttp://preventdisease.com/fitness/nutrition/articles/healthyeating.html.\n\nTry and make sure your last meal is 5 hours before you sleep.  If you must have something after that point it should only be a protein shake or water.  Stick to complex carbs (brown rice, potatoes) before 6pm and no carbs after 6pm.  Balance acid forming foods with base forming food to optimize digestion.\nhttp://preventdisease.com/fitness/nutrition/articles/acid_alkaline.html#\n\nCutting 500 calories a day will do nothing if your exceeding your calorie expediture.  For energy requirements, the first thing you have to do is assess your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)& AMR (Active Metabolic Rate) to assess your daily energy requirements. \n\nhttp://preventdisease.com/healthtools/articles/bmr.html\n\nOnce you have established how many calories you burn per day, your goal should then be to maintain the calorie deficit on a daily basis for gradual weight loss is achieved.  If your goal is to cut back on 500 calories through exercise and your combined BMR & AMR is 3000, then you better be sure you are not consuming more than 2500 calories.\n\nTrack your progress daily in a journal and tweak either your diet or activity level according to your progress until you get it right.\n\nIt's doubtful you are burning 700-800 calories by walking 50 minutes unless you are over 250 pounds and your rate is very brisk.  Use this calculator to help you figure it out.\n\nhttp://preventdisease.com/healthtools/articles/while_walking200.html", "doctor_answer": "Actually, it is a established fact that 3500 calories are equal to one pound.  What is less accurate are the calorie outputs displayed on fitness machines.  They can approximate what your expended effort based on your weight will be, but they are FAR from accurate.  Under no circumstances should you assume they are correct.  Instead, use them as a guideline or reference to help you quantify your cardio effort.\n\nWeight loss is a long-term effort, and while fitness is a key element, it isn't the only part of the equation.  Keep it up--consistentcy is what will guarantee your success."}

The most common form is localized granuloma annulare, which is characterized by the presence of small, firm red or yellow colored bumps (nodules or papules) that appear arranged in a ring on the skin. In most cases, the sizes of the lesions range from one to five centimeters. The most commonly affected sites include the feet, hands, and fingers. In addition to the localized form, there are four less common forms: generalized or disseminated, linear, perforating, and subcutaneous. The lesions associated with granuloma annulare usually disappear without treatment (spontaneous remission). However, the lesions often reappear. The exact cause of granuloma annulare is unknown.\n\nI looked in pubmed but the research is too gastly to go into. Your friend should look at diet as the cure. Very strict low fat, very low simple carbs and many low acid fruits and vegies.\n\n\nLook on pubmed.com this site is where the doctors post thier theories and experiments.

{"question": "are chiropractors real doctors?", "patient_answer": "It depends on what you mean by \"real doctors.\" They are not medical doctors, and cannot perform surgery, prescribe medication nor admit persons to hospitals. They do have doctor of chiropractic degrees, and are considered chiropractic physicians. \n\nChiropractic has been shown to be effective for low back pain and some other back/neck problems. One of the problems with chiropractic, in my mind, is that many chiropractors claim to treat an entire range of problems, including attention deficit disorder, learning disbilities, diabetes, and many other physical problems that have no known relationship to spinal misalignment. These persons have done a lot of damage to the chiropractic profession, and it has lead to laws in a number of states that regulate chiropractic care more like a consumer good than a medical service. Check out this part of the North Carolina law governing chiropractic practice:\n\n90-154.1 Collection of certain fees prohibited.\n\nAny patient or any other person responsible for payment has the right to refuse to pay, cancel payment, or be reimbursed for payment for any service, examination, or treatment other than the advertised reduced rate service, examination or treatment which is performed as a result of and within 72 hours of responding to any advertisement for a free or reduced rate service, free or reduced rate examination, or free or reduced rate treatment. Any further treatment shall be agreed upon in writing and signed by both parties.\n  \nAny chiropractic advertisement that offers a free or reduced rate service, examination or treatment shall contain the following notice to prospective patients: \"If you decide to purchase additional treatment, you have the legal right to change your mind within three days and receive a refund.\" If the advertisement is published in print, the foregoing notice shall appear in capital letters clearly distinguishable from the rest of the text. If the advertisement is broadcast on radio or television, the foregoing notice shall be recited at the end of the advertisement.\n  \nAny bill sent to a patient or any other person responsible for payment as a result of the patient responding to a chiropractic advertisement shall clearly contain the language of the first sentence of subsection (a) and have distinguished on its face the charge for the reduced rate services, including and itemization, of free services, and the separate charge for any services, examinations or treatments other than the advertised free or reduced rate services, examinations, or treatments. The reduced rate charges shall be labeled \"Free or Reduced Tate Charges\" and any other charges shall be labeled \"Non-advertised Services, Examinations, or Treatments.\"", "doctor_answer": "Nope.  According to this site, they get undergraduate educations plus two-four years of chiropractic educations...not too shabby but not the same education that \"real\" doctors get (i.e., med school+internships).\n\nhttp://www.chiropractic.org/index.php?p=chiroinfo/main\nhttp://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos071.htm\n\nI've known some people who have sworn by chiropractors.  I've also known some people who think, like this site, that they are quacks:\n\nhttp://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/chiro.html\n\nI think the best thing you can do if you're interested in visiting a chiropractor is to ask around and see if you know anybody who can recommend one from first-hand experience."}

{"question": "What are leaches used for in medicine now?", "patient_answer": "When doctors reattach parts like fingers, the arteries are easier to reattach than veins. So what ends up happening is that blood gets clogged up in the finger due to poor vein connections. Leeches are used to suck out the extra blood until the veins heal naturally. The added benefit is that the leeches inject a natural anti-coagulant to the blood which prevents the formation of clots.", "doctor_answer": "They're like when you suck out a snake bite.

{"question": "what seems to be the problem when you have weird cravings for dirt,gasoline,oil, unnatural things?", "patient_answer": "Many young children put nonfood items in their mouths at one time or another. They're naturally curious about their environment, and they may, for instance, eat some dirt out of the sandbox. Kids with pica, however, go beyond this innocent exploration of their surroundings. As many as 25% to 30% of kids (and 20% of those seen in mental health clinics) have an eating disorder called pica, which is characterized by persistent and compulsive cravings (lasting 1 month or longer) to eat nonfood items. \n\nWhat Is Pica?\nThe word pica comes from the Latin word for magpie, a bird known for its large and indiscriminate appetite. \n\nPica is most common in people with developmental disabilities, including autism and mental retardation, and in children between the ages of 2 and 3. Although kids younger than 18 to 24 months can try to eat nonfood items, it isn't necessarily considered abnormal at that age. \n\nPica is also a behavior that may also surface in children who've had a brain injury affecting their development.

{"question": "what is \"cherubism\"?", "patient_answer": "Cherubism: A genetic disorder of childhood that leads to prominence of the lower face and an appearance reminiscent of the cherubs portrayed in Renaissance art.\n\nCherubism is due to a problem in bone formation that is largely limited to the upper and lower jaws (the maxilla and mandible) with loss of bone in the jaws and its replacement by excessive amounts of fibrous tissue. These abnormalities often resolve after puberty.\n\nCherubism is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. Most boys and girls with it have a parent who had cherubism, while the few children with cherubism without a family history are thought to have a new mutation (a newly arisen gene) for cherubism but can transmit it to their children.\n\nThe gene for cherubism is on chromosome 4. It is specifically in chromosome band 4p16.3 and is called SH3BP2 (for SH3-domain binding protein 2). Exactly how a mutation in SH3BP2 leads to cherubism is not yet known.", "doctor_answer": "It's a hereditary and progressive bilateral swelling at the angle of the mandible, sometimes involving the entire jaw. It is called cherubism because the swelling imparts a cherubic look to the face, in some cases enhanced by upturning of the eyes."}

{"question": "what is the best defense for severe chrons disease besides surgery?", "patient_answer": "Treatment for Crohn's disease depends on the location and severity of disease, complications, and response to previous treatment. Treatment may include drugs, nutrition supplements, surgery, or a combination of these options. At this time, treatment can help control the disease, but there is no cure.", "doctor_answer": "I would start by seeing an MD who tends to specialize in Crohns (more than a typical GI doc).  Let them do whatever minimally invasive tests they think approporiate (including imaging and, perhaps, being scoped) and go from there.\n\n There is no cure per se but there are a variety of approaches that can help tame it in many people (and it can go into remission).  Diet and medications are probably worth an effort -- and new meds have come on line in the last 5 to 10 years.  An odd factoid: Nicotine seems to delay the onset in most adults by several years.\n\nPersonal observation:  My mom had pretty severe Crohns and, while the local docs wanted to do surgery, the advice she got from the Mayo clinic was to hold off.  A few years later, she ended up with a heart transplant and the med regime for that (a fairly nasty mix to be sure) put the Crohns into more or less permanent remission."}
{"question": "what is the best way to fight a cold?", "patient_answer": "Common treatments include: analgesics such as aspirin or acetaminophen, as well as localised versions targeting the throat (often delivered in lozenge form), nasal decongestants which reduce the inflammation in the nasal passages by constricting local blood vessels, cough suppressants (which work to suppress the cough reflex of the brain or by diluting the mucus in the lungs), and first-generation anti-histamines such as brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, and clemastine (which reduce mucus gland secretion and thus combat blocked/runny noses but also may make the user drowsy). Second generation anti-histamines do not have a useful effect on colds.\n\nA warm and humid environment and drinking lots of fluids, especially hot liquids, alleviate symptoms somewhat. Common home remedies include camomile or lemon tisanes and chicken soup (which probably work by soothing the irritated respiratory passages with their steam), nebulized medicinal mixtures, hot compresses, mustard plasters, hot toddies, licorice and echinacea. Although there have been scientific studies done on echinacea, its effectiveness has not been demonstrated. Eating very spicy food can help alleviate congestion, although it may also irritate the already-tender throat. Coffee, or its active component, caffeine, has also been shown to improve mood and mental performance during rhinovirus infection. Hot beer is also recommended, and though it probably does little to fight the infection directly, at least it can help to a good night of relaxed sleep. However, alcohol dehydrates the body which is counterproductive; also cold medicine (aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, etc) should never be taken along with alcohol.", "doctor_answer": "If you catch it early, try Zinc Gluconate losenges. They can make the cold less severe."}

{"question": "How can I calm cravings?", "patient_answer": "You need to divert your attention.  Start thinking of food as a tool to maintain life rather than something fun to do.  If you can put some restrictions on yourself it will help.  \nFrom now on, each time you want something that isn't healthy or a part of a meal tell yourself you are only allowed to have it if you first walk around the block.  That way it will take your mind off of it.  If you still want it after the walk go ahead and eat it.  Or if you want an even harder fix, figure out how many calories are in the item, then figure out how long you would have to walk or run to burn the calories.  You can then force yourself to do that much exercise before eating the item.  \n\nI know it's hard, but eventually you'll get to a point where it's just not worth it to you to eat the item.  Also, allow yourself a cheat here or there.  Total deprivation never works.", "doctor_answer": "I have to agree with \"I Know - Pick me\"  The more you eat sweets the more you want.  If you can cut out all sugars and carbohydrates for 2 weeks, your cravings will be drastically reduced.

It is typically characterized by an aspherical cornea in which one axis of corneal steepness is greater than the perpendicular axis. Astigmatism causes difficulties in seeing fine detail, and can be often corrected by glasses with a cylindrical lens (i.e. a lens that has different radii of curvature in different planes), contact lenses, or refractive surgery.\n\nAstigmatism occurs when either the cornea or the lens of the eye is not perfectly spherical. As a result, the eye has different focal points in different planes. For example, the image may be clearly focused on the retina in the horizontal plane, but in front of the retina in the vertical plane.\n\nIn some cases vertical lines i.e. walls, may appear to the patient to be leaning over like the tower of Pisa.", "doctor_answer": "NOUN: \n\nA visual defect in which the unequal curvature of one or more refractive surfaces of the eye, usually the cornea, prevents light rays from focusing clearly at one point on the retina, resulting in blurred vision. \n\n\nETYMOLOGY: \na- 1 + Greek stigma , stigmat-, point (from stizein , stig-, to tattoo; see steig- in Indo-European roots)\n\nOTHER FORMS: \nastig·matic   (stg-mtk) KEY  (Adjective) (Noun), astig·mati·cal·ly (Adverb)"}

{"question": "What is vitiligo?", "patient_answer": "Vitiligo\n\nWhat causes vitiligo?\nThe cause of vitiligo is not fully known, but there are several theories. One theory of some substance is that people with vitiligo develop antibodies that, instead of protecting them, turn upon them and destroy their own melanocytes, the special cells that produce the pigment melanin that colors their skin.\n\nAnother theory is that the melanocytes somehow attack and destroy themselves. Finally, some people with vitiligo have reported that a single event such as a severe sunburn or an episode of emotional distress seem to have triggered their vitiligo. Events of this nature, however, have not been scientifically proven to cause vitiligo and may simply be coincidences.", "doctor_answer": "Vitiligo is a dermatological condition characterized by the appearance of white patches of skin on different parts of the body as a result of the destruction of the cells that make pigment (melanocytes).

However, if enough energy is not used for defibrillation, the heart may not be completely depolarized, in which case the ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation may not be terminated.

{"question": "average age of suicide for police officers?", "patient_answer": "I tend to disagree with the above answer. As a police officer there are siuations you are forced to deal with. Depending on your own mental stability and ability to work thru your own crisis ,along with everybody elses, at the same time is dependent on how you can deal with this stress. The sight of a young child screaming, burning or dead weighs heavy on every officer's mind. The fact you may be envolved with something out of your control sends many officers over the edge. There was a study done and the average age of a police officer is 52. Police officers have the highest suicide rate of any other profession. Living with the fact that as you put the uniform on the thought that you may never make it back home to hug your children or spouse again can be devestating. Each officer should be proud of what they do, and I proudly call each and every one my brother or sister.", "doctor_answer": "Being a police officer isn't a risk factor for suicide.  The nature of the job elicits a profile of candidates that resemble risk groups.  For instance sixty percent of suicides are firearm related.  Of suicide 85% are males. The biggest risk group is male 15-24 years old.  Males are 4x more likely to die from suicide than their female counter parts, High anxiety level...all these things are more common in police officers than any other profession I can think of.  But I would think in law enforcement the local social culture is a big contributor: New York, September 11th.\n\nI can think of no studies that look at police officers' age and the corresponding suicide rate."}

{"question": "should I wash pillows after strep?", "patient_answer": "Bacteria are almost always transmitted by contact with tiny droplets from an infected person. Strep throat is passed from one person to another by contact with the tiny droplets of an infected person's cough, sneeze, or breath. \nBacteria can also live for a short time on doorknobs, water faucets, and other objects. If you touch an infected object and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, you can become infected with the bacteria or virus. So in essence any bacteria on a sheet would die relatively quickly.", "doctor_answer": "If you have a strep throut you will most likesy cough, even at night when you go to bed. If you are coughing on your pillow you are basically coughing up germs and bacteria which can lead to other ilnesses. So in my oppinion I would either change my pillow case and wash tho dirty one."}

{"question": "What is anemia?? Can you tell me about the different types of anemia?", "patient_answer": "Anemia occurs because patients either can't produce enough red blood cells or because red blood cells are lost (bleeding) or destroyed faster than they can be produced. Many different causes of anemia exist. \nIron deficiency anemia. This is the most common type of anemia. It happens when you don't have enough iron in your body. You need iron to make hemoglobin. This can happen when you lose blood from problems like heavy periods, ulcers, colon polyps, or colon cancer. A diet that doesn't have enough iron in it can also cause IDA. Pregnancy can also cause IDA if there's not enough iron for the mother and fetus. \nMegaloblastic (or vitamin deficiency) anemia. This most often happens when your body doesn't get enough folic acid or vitamin B-12. These vitamins help your body keep healthy blood and a healthy nervous system. With this type of anemia, your body makes red blood cells that can't deliver oxygen right. Sometimes, with this disease, your health care provider may not realize you're not getting enough B-12. This usually happens to someone with pernicious anemia, a type of autoimmune disease. B-12 deficiency may also be more common in people with other autoimmune diseases, like Crohn's disease. Not getting enough B-12 can cause numbness in your legs and feet, problems walking, memory loss, and problems seeing. The treatment depends on the cause. But you may need to get B-12 shots or take special B-12 pills. \nUnderlying diseases. Certain diseases can hurt the body's ability to make red blood cells. For example, people with kidney disease, especially those getting dialysis (takes out wastes from your blood if your kidneys can't), are at higher risk for developing anemia. Their kidneys can't create enough hormones to make blood cells, and iron is lost in dialysis. \nInherited blood disease. If you have a blood disease in your family, there is a higher risk that you will also have this disease. One type of inherited blood disease is sickle cell anemia. Instead of having normal red blood cells that move through blood vessels easily, sickle cells are hard and have a curved edge. These cells cannot squeeze through small blood vessels and block the organs from getting blood. Your body destroys sickle red cells quickly, but it can't make new red blood cells fast enough. This causes anemia. Another inherited blood disease is thalassemia. It happens when the body is missing certain genes or when variant (different from normal) genes are passed down from parents that affect how the body makes hemoglobin. \nAplastic anemia. This rare problem happens when your body doesn't make enough red blood cells. Since this affects the white blood cells too, there is a higher risk for infections and bleeding that can't be stopped. This can be caused by many things: cancer treatments (radiation or chemotherapy) exposure to toxic chemicals (like those used in some insecticides, paint, and household cleaners) some drugs (like those that treat rheumatoid arthritis) autoimmune disease(like lupus)viral infection that affects bone marrow or\nbone marrow diseases", "doctor_answer": "Anemia (American English) or anaemia (Commonwealth English), which literally means \"without blood,\" is a deficiency of red blood cells and/or hemoglobin. This results in a reduced ability of blood to transfer oxygen to the tissues, and this causes hypoxia; since all human cells depend on oxygen for survival, varying degrees of anemia can have a wide range of clinical consequences. Hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cells) has to be present to ensure adequate oxygenation of all body tissues and organs.\n\nThe three main classes of anemia include excessive blood loss (acutely such as a hemorrhage or chronically through low-volume loss), excessive red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) or deficient red blood cell production. In menstruating women, dietary iron deficiency is a common cause of deficient red blood cell production.\n\nFollow the link for more information.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"}

{"question": "Does anybody know anything about intuitive eating?", "patient_answer": "Listen to what your body wants. If you are really craving a hamburger, you probably need protein. If that doughnut looks really good, have some carbohydrates. Your body gets cravings because it needs something from a certain food group. Eating something healthier yet similar can be just a satisfying.", "doctor_answer": "How to Hear What Your Body Needs\nThe SAD diet (standard American diet) really is sad. Most of us consume so much damaged fat, toxic chemicals, sugar, and processed, unhealthy foods that we have lost touch with what our bodies really need. Eating should be an intuitive process, but there are things that can interfere with intuitive eating.\n\n    * Being caught up in research and theories about the \"best\" diet.\n      The value of intuition in eating is lost in our knowledge and science-driven world. Animals instinctively know everything they need to live and they do it. We have the same instinct, but it gets lost in what we are told we should eat by researchers, diet gurus, parents, spouses, talk show hosts, magazines, celebrities and friends.\n\n    * Making weight loss your primary focus.\n      The weight loss industry in the United States is a billion dollar industry. It can harm your metabolism, your wallet, and your confidence. Many chronic dieters develop long-term side effects from being on the wrong diet, such as fatigue and weakness, anxiety, depression, dark circles under the eyes, headaches, joint pain, and poor concentration. They can deprive your body of essential nutrients that it needs to rebuild and can stimulate the release of stress hormones.\n\n    * Chronic stress or illness.\n      Many people under chronic stress lose their taste for food. They view food as fuel or they lose sensitivity to hunger signals. Chronic stress can destabilize blood sugar levels resulting in increased cravings and a constant need to eat. People sometimes become hungry soon after meals and feel lightheaded and faint if they are not able to eat. In addition, chronic stress can trigger irritable bowel, bloating, gas, and pain regardless of what you eat. \nHow to improve your intuitive ability\n\n   1. Start by paying attention to how different foods make you feel.\n\n          * What foods leave satisfied?\n          * What foods give you energy?\n          * What foods make you tired or unable to concentrate?\n          * What foods make you anxious or edgy vs. calm and content?\n          * What foods make you bloated, uncomfortable, or cause pain?\n\n   2. Reduce the amount of junk foods and sugar in your diet.\n\n          * Substitute fruit and then gradually decrease. If you have a sweet tooth, try to gradually substitute the sugar in your diet with fruit. Fruit contains sugar but also has fiber, phytochemicals and antioxidants. Gradually taper the fruit until you are at a level that feels right to you.\n\n          * Use a herbal sweetener. The herbal sweetener Stevia can be used to add sweetness to any dish. Some brands are better than others -- if you try a brand that tastes quite bitter, keep looking.\n\n          * Try spices with a sweet flavor. The spices cinnamon and cloves have a sweet taste, even though they don't contain any sugar. Try making Chai tea, or adding cinnamon to drinks, sauces and desserts for a sweet flavor.\n\n          * Healthier sweeteners. If you do use sugar, try mixing unrefined blackstrap molasses with just enough honey or another natural sweetener to take the bitter edge off the molasses. One tablespoon of blackstrap molasses contains about 179 mg of calcium and 518 mg of potassium. All natural sweeteners such as honey and molasses are still forms of sugar, so don't go overboard on these thinking they are okay."}

{"question": "is it typical for a 2 year old to studder?", "patient_answer": "Young children when they are learning to speak often hesitate or repeat sounds when attempting to pronounce words. This can lead parents to believe that the child is stuttering, or stammering, when in fact it is little more than part of the speech learning process. I have three kids and the youngest is going through the same stage now. She will be two next month. However, approximately 1% of people in the world stutter to some degree or another and it could be that the child in question does have a speech impediment of this kind. If this is the case then no it is not normal but neither is it unheard of. Moreover, the vast majority of children who suffer from genuine as opposed to pseudo stuttering, recover naturally from this condition with only a very small minority carrying the impediment forward into later life. So, if you are the parent of this child, I wouldn't worry yourself too much at this stage but you should monitor the situation and particularly so over the next year. If speech improves as the child learns more words and how to pronounce them, then fine. If the situation deteriorates and you have sound reason to believe that a stutter exists, then it might at that time be wise to consult a speech therapist.    \n\nTo put your mind at rest, the following web pages are very informative:\n\nhttp://www.keepkidshealthy.com/welcome/conditions/stuttering.html\nhttp://pediatrics.about.com/cs/weeklyquestion/a/kids_stuttering.htm \nhttp://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Stuttering?open", "doctor_answer": "yes people studder because they talk to fast or like my ma always say when people tickle u studder and i think its try"}

{"question": "why is my ear popping when I'm not at a high altitude?", "patient_answer": "The other answer is correct -- there is a difference in air pressure in the space behind the eardrum (called the middle ear) and the air outside.  This can happen when the Eustachian tube that connects the middle ear space to the back of the throat is not opening properly as it should when yawning or swallowing.  \n\nThe causes of this can be inflammation due to a cold or allergies.  Some people have problems due to enlarged adenoids or tonsils.  Other conditions can also cause the sensation of pressure in the middle ear, but are typically accompanied by other symptoms like spinning dizziness (vertigo) or ringing/buzzing in the ear (tinnitus).  Ear wax (cerumen) build up can make you feel clogged, but doesn't usually cause a popping sensation.  \n\nA quick fix is to hold your nose and mouth closed and blow gently, which will force air pressure up into the middle ear space.  This is called the Val Salva maneuver.  Some people respond well to nasal allergy sprays or other allergy treatments.  If the problem persists for more than a week or two see your doctor or an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist.", "doctor_answer": "It could be from wax build up in the ear. If it becomes too uncomfortable, you should see an ear doctor. He/she can flush your ears out."}

{"question": "Why does a massage feel good?", "patient_answer": "Who can top that ?", "doctor_answer": "The constant use of muscles in our bodies produces an acid called 'lactic acid', this type of acid makes our muscles feel tired, and can cause them to cramp, or just stop working that efficiently.\n\nThe massage, or slow movement of the muscle in a rhythmic fasion allows our bodies to purge the muscle of lactice acid to some extent.  Normally it allows the person to 'sooth' the aches and pains of the cramping muscles.\n\nThe massage is ideally performed in a standard up and down movement over the muscle.  A kneading method is typically used to massage muscles that are overused.  Percussion and chops are used mainly to remove extreme knots, ect and make the muscle regions more suceptable to kneading to remove the acid.\n\nHowever, it isn't just to remove acid from the muscle.  Massaging the muscle also strenghtens it.  It allows the muscle to move without too much effort, and allows the body to heal quicker from wounds directly related to the muscle.\n\nHope that helped."}

If you aren't wanting to maintain that schedule, you have to start with better habits.\n\nNo caffeine 6-8 hours before the time you go to bed.\nNo working out 1-2 hours before bed.\nNo TV or reading in bed.\nGo to bed at the same time nightly\nWake up at the same time each morning\n\nSome people benefit from a light box that simulates sunlight that you will turn on each morning...probably just opening curtains and turning on lots of light in the house will suffice. \n\nIndividuals will vary, of course, but I'd suspect that if you follow a good regime you can be on a better schedule with little back lag in about 2 weeks, maybe 4.\n\nIf you end up partying late on a weekend, you'll foul yourself up, so try to maintain your schedule consistantly.\n\nIf all else fails, you can always go to a sleep lab and consult a sleep specialist if this stuff doesn't help out.\n\ngood luck", "doctor_answer": "It depends on how you help it along.

When toxins build up in the system, the liver and kidneys are unable to function optimally and the body begins to store toxins in the tissues.  As the toxins build up, common symptoms occur, such as fatigue, headaches, irritability, insomnia, depression, poor digestion, bad breath, allergies, skin problems, and over time may even lead to chronic illnesses like cancer, arthritis and Alzheimer’s disease.\"\n\nInfo quoted from http://newbetteryou.com"}

{"question": "any tips for dealing with razor bumps?", "patient_answer": "Before anything else, let your hair grow out for a while and give your skin a rest before shaving again (a minimum of three days). \nBumps can get infected fairly easily, so tend to them immediately. Using a local antibiotic will probably help, especially if there's a cut. \nDon't pick at or squeeze bumps. That will tend to make things worse. \nMake sure to get your hair very wet before shaving, ideally after taking a bath or shower. If you don't shower first, wet your hair for at least two minutes with warm, soapy water. Wet hair cuts better and easier than dry hair, and is more likely to cut evenly (and not at an angle). \nUse a good shaving cream to reduce friction and irritation. Really work the shaving cream into your scalp for at least two minutes, and save areas that tend to develope bumps for last when you're shaving, so that the shaving cream has longer to soften the hair. \nShave with the grain, not against it. \nDon't go over the same area more than twice. \nDon't stretch out your skin while shaving; let is stay neutral and relaxed. Stretching your skin while you shave increases the chance that the hair will 'snap back' to below skin level. \nReplace your blade regularly. Shaving with a dull blade increases the chances of hair tearing unevenly. \nUse a single-blade razor instead of a double- or triple-blade razor. The 'lift and cut' effect of multi-blade razors is something people with PFB generally try to avoid.", "doctor_answer": "well what u need to do is use the best disposable u can afford , if that doesnt work, a good electrict should solve your problem, if not i dont like the chemicals so i guess i would either keep a short beard or spend some bucks and get it electrically removed"}
{"question": "How do I stick to a diabetic diet and stay away from sweets. I am having a hard time.?", "patient_answer": "Also a diabetic, I found that sugar free things like diet gelatin and using Splenda when cooking and baking helps satisfy my sweet tooth. Zero grams of carb in that diet gelatin, so one can have all they want.  Zero sugar or carbs in whipped cream, when sweetened with Splenda or another artificial sweetner.  You can have all you want and not blow your sugar.\n\nI stay entirely away from white flour 'cause it goes to sugar in the blood stream faster than sugar.  Ditto for rice and pastas, breads.  \n\nThe glycemic index -- a chart that tells how fast any food goes to sugar can be helpful.  I've posted the links below.  That way you can pick and choose the foods you like and know how much you can have of them. As long as you stay with foods that are rated 55 and below, you won't be hungry and won't raise your blood sugar.\n\nIf you learn to read the labels and look for those carbohydrates.  You  may be pleasantly surprised at what you can eat -- and also how much hidden sugar is in other foods one would think were safe.  \n\nOccasionally I have a piece of chocolate.  If I take only a couple of squares, it's 7 grams of sugar.  Not enough to raise blood sugar. If I instead have one of those fruit stirred yogurts, it might contain as much as 46 grams of sugar.  Chocolate?  Yogurt? One could eat the whole candy bar and not get as much sugar as in one of those little \"lite\" diet yogurts filled with sugar.\n\nI have made low carb cheesecake with NO sugar.  Those I served it to didn't know, couldn't tell the difference between mine and Lindy's or any other cheesecake.  Splenda bakes up just like sugar and tastes the same -- no aftertaste.  So experiment with recipes for sweets and substitute something other than sugar.\n\nI have found the best success by making my own diet of foods I like, but watching the carbs.  Especially the refined ones -- like while flour, sugar (watermelon and other sweet fruits, corn, carrots, even beets) , starches (potatoes, rice). I eliminated them.\n\nAnd, most importantly have breakfast in the morning. That will start your  metabolism going.  If you can make it a high protein one, like eggs, meat, milk, plain yogurt, a piece of fruit -- all low carb choices, you will find you won't get hungry and crave sweets and your metabolism will start to burn and stay at a slow, steady burn all morning.\n\nThere are sugar free diet puddings, one can make whipped cream with Splenda or Nutra Sweet, have a piece of fruit (apple), peanut butter on a slice of apple, an occasional piece of candy (just don't eat the whole  bag or box at one sitting), and not feel deprived. Watch your blood sugar, and that will be your guide to what you can eat and how foods affect you.\n\nWith diabetes one's metabolism of sugars plays havoc with our appetite and our energy level.  The secret is keeping one's blood sugar level -- not allowing it to rise fast,which taking in a lot of sugar does to us, and then crashes leaving us hungry and tired.  Proteins digest slowly and release energy slowly,but consistently.  Proteins and fats satisfy our hunger for a longer time.  So adjusting your diet to eliminate the foods that raise blood sugar rapidly like the refined carbohydrates and sweets and replacing them with proteins and fiber, will actually reduce and maybe eliminate your craving for sweets\nGood luck and you can write me if you wish more links and info.  rubysnowdragon@yahoo.com", "doctor_answer": "eat candy but use the \"fun sized\" ones not too many a day though because it will raise your blood sugar and too much sugar free candy will give you the runs so give in once in a while.

The middle ear gets infected more often, but after you pass the age of six, that decreases too.\n\nNow, to the poster's question:  it depends on how old you are.  The most likely cause of your condition is something called Benign Positional Vertigo (you can also look up Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo).\n\nBPV is a common, often self-limiting condition in which calcium crystals in \"those little tube thingies\" in your inner ear that keep you in balance get disloged and start floating.  Now, when you turn your head, especially to a particular side, the little tube thingies (aka, \"the vestibular system\") on one side of your head has very smooth flow of fluid; the system on the other side of your head has a different flow of fluid.  The brain interprets the different signals from the two sides of your head as imbalance.\n\nMy recommendation? Go see an ear doctor.

{"question": "why does it feel good to kill brain cells?", "patient_answer": "First of all most of the substances that are widely believed to kill brain cells do not. They will however alter the chemistry of the brain. This is not to say that it's good to do these things. It is mostly due to the anti drug histeria that began in the early 20th century. Most drugs were used as medicine in the early days. It's when drug abuse occurs that it can be of such a detriment. You can do very real damage to your brain with some of the most widely used drugs available today, alcohol among them. But it is the inhalants that do the damage the fastest. They impart chemical compounds into the bloodstream instead of Oxygen. Thus the brain is robbed of its most vital element. Brain cells then die by the millions. The notion that you become brain damaged by using marijuana or opiates is a bit misleading. The balance of normal brain chemicals is altered, maybe forever, but they are still not killing brain cells. Cocaine is another drug commonly used. It effects the brain chemistry also, but is more damaging to the heart. It kills heart cells on contact in laboratory experiments. It may also be harmful due to the powerful solvents it contains as a residue leftover from its manufacturing process. If you are going to use these substances you should at least inform yourself as to the damage you're doing to your body.", "doctor_answer": "substances which \"kill\" your brains cells activate a part of your brain which produces euphoria.  This is \"feeling good\".  In using these substances, your brain becomes lazy and doesn't produce it's own euphoric enzymes which make us \"happy\".  In the case of ethanol or \"alcoholic beverages\" it is a poison which anesthetizes cells of many body organs and depletes the oxygen in the bloodstream which keeps the cells alive and functioning.  ...and it does feel bad when you sober up and stop using the chemicals because your body is telling you what you did to it."}
{"question": "richest source on vit. b12 in vegitarian food?", "patient_answer": "I don't know.", "doctor_answer": "The only reliable unfortified sources of vitamin B12 are meat, dairy products and eggs. There has been considerable research into possible plant food sources of B12. Fermented soya products, seaweeds and algae have all been proposed as possible sources of B12. However, analysis of fermented soya products, including tempeh, miso, shoyu and tamari, found no significant B12.\n\nSpirulina, an algae available as a dietary supplement in tablet form, and nori, a seaweed, have both appeared to contain significant amounts of B12 after analysis. However, it is thought that this is due to the presence of compounds structurally similar to B12, known as B12 analogues. These cannot be utilised to satisfy dietary needs. Assay methods used to detect B12 are unable to differentiate between B12 and it's analogues, Analysis of possible B12 sources may give false positive results due to the presence of these analogues.\n\nResearchers have suggested that supposed B12 supplements such as spirulina may in fact increase the risk of B12 deficiency disease, as the B12 analogues can compete with B12 and inhibit metabolism.\n\nThe current nutritional consensus is that no plant foods can be relied on as a safe source of vitamin B12.\n\nBacteria present in the large intestine are able to synthesise B12. In the past, it has been thought that the B12 produced by these colonic bacteria could be absorbed and utilised by humans. However, the bacteria produce B12 too far down the intestine for absorption to occur, B12 not being absorbed through the colon lining.\n\nHuman faeces can contain significant B12. A study has shown that a group of Iranian vegans obtained adequate B12 from unwashed vegetables which had been fertilised with human manure. Faecal contamination of vegetables and other plant foods can make a significant contribution to dietary needs, particularly in areas where hygiene standards may be low. This may be responsible for the lack of aneamia due to B12 deficiency in vegan communities in developing countries.\n\nGood sources of vitamin B12 for vegetarians are dairy products or free-range eggs. ½ pint of milk (full fat or semi skimmed) contains 1.2 µg. A slice of vegetarian cheddar cheese (40g) contains 0.5 µg. A boiled egg contains 0.7 µg. Fermentation in the manufacture of yoghurt destroys much of the B12 present. Boiling milk can also destroy much of the B12.\n\nVegans are recommended to ensure their diet includes foods fortified with vitamin B12. A range of B12 fortified foods are available. These include yeast extracts, Vecon vegetable stock, veggieburger mixes, textured vegetable protein, soya milks, vegetable and sunflower margarines, and breakfast cereals."}

They have affected humans since we were living in caves, and before recorded history.  Human stds do not affect animals, therefore it is very unlikely that stds originated in any animal population.  HIV is different in that it evolved from simian immunodeficiency virus and had a chance to evolve and mutate in humans to HIV.  A retro-virus like HIV is very different than a bacterial infection like gonorrhea, syphilis, or a virus like Hepres.\n\nInstead of wondering where they came from, or speculating about bestiality, why not get rational, good information on signs & symptoms of STDs, and educate your friends and families on how to protect themselves.  You'll do yourself a great favor, and provide a great service to your community."}

{"question": "what is abdominal compartment syndrome?", "patient_answer": "Compartment syndrome occurs when a fixed compartment, defined by myofascial elements or bone, becomes subject to increased pressure, leading to ischemia and organ dysfunction. Well recognized to occur in the extremities, it also occurs in the abdomen, and some believe, in the intracranial cavity. The exact clinical conditions that define abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) are controversial; however, organ dysfunction caused by intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is considered to be ACS. The dysfunction may be respiratory insufficiency secondary to compromised tidal volumes, decreased urine output caused by falling renal perfusion, or any organ dysfunction associated with impaired perfusion.", "doctor_answer": "Massive intestinal oedema often follows laparotomy for major trauma where there has been prolonged shock. Crystalloid resuscitation, capillary leakage due to activated inflammatory mediators and reperfusion injury all contribute to this tissue swelling. Combined with intra-abdominal packing or retroperitoneal haematomas this may render the abdomen difficult or impossible to close. If the abdomen is closed, intra-abdominal pressure may rise to a level (>25 cmH2O) where it leads to significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal and cerebral dysfunction."}

{"question": "What causes canker sores?", "patient_answer": "Small and out-of-sight, but painful, persistent and annoying.

IT IS NOT CAUSED BY HERPES (Cold sores are caused by Herpes).\n\nResearchers generally believe that stress or tissue injury may cause the eruption of canker sores. A minor injury, such as biting the inside of your mouth, may trigger a canker sore. Other causes may include:\n\n*Faulty immune system function \n*Nutritional problems such as a deficiency of vitamin B-12, zinc, folic acid or iron \n*A disease of the gastrointestinal tract \n*Food allergies \n*Menstrual periods \n\nThough anyone can get cankers sores, they tend to run in families and may be an inheritable condition.\n\n(This information was obtained at the mayo Clinic Website.)", "doctor_answer": "Herpes."}

{"question": "Can black licorice candy cause heart problems?", "patient_answer": "The high blood pressure associated with true black licorice is liked to a chemical called glycyrrhizin, which comes from the licorice plant (Glycyrrhiza glabra).  Once in the body and transformed into glycyrrhizic acid, this chemical inhibits the enzyme (11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) that converts cortisol to cortisone.  Cortisol can bind to the same receptors that aldosterone can (they are both steroid hormones).  So ultimately, the intake of glycyrrhizin leads to the body believing it has a higher level of aldosterone in the body.  This subsequently leads to water and sodium retention, higher blood volume, and therefore, higher blood pressure.\n\nAccording to Hershey's webiste, Twizzlers (a product of Hershey's) is actually made to taste like black licorice, but does not contain either glycyrrhizin or glycyrrhizic acid.  Now, it may contain other ingredients that can still increase blood pressure (sugar in general can increase blood pressure but usually by smaller amounts) but it will not fake out the body that aldosterone levels are high.  The only sure-fire way to know if true licorice extract (and therefore glycyrrhizin) is inside the candy is to read the label or contact the manufacturer.  If it's made with licorice extract or \"made from licorice root\", stay away (if you have high blood pressure).   Otherwise, enjoy!", "doctor_answer": "There are health benefits to licorice and health risks\nI would say if you have blood pressue issues limit yourself when it comes to black licorice. I don't think there is anyway to really tell how much of the  hormone like aldosterone is in the licorice\nAs for the Twizzlers they might actually be the best brand if you have to have an occasional piece of licorice, because if you have ever had that and then some of the gourmet and natural licorices you will know what I mean that the Twizzlers is rather mild.\nI am not saying safe just that it is milder."}

{"question": "Why do people faint in the face of danger?", "patient_answer": "People that faint in the face of danger, are suffering from a suddenly and significant drop in blood pressure.\n\nFainting is actually a valuable self protective response.When blood pressure drops this way, there is a chance the brain won't get enough blood, because it's at the highest point of the body. That's no good - your brain needs a steady supply of the oxygen the blood carries. So when your body can't get enough blood to your brain because of low blood pressure, it protects you by bringing your brain down to the blood. In other words, the purpose of a faint is to ensure a blood supply to the brain by bringing your head down to the ground, so your heart doesn't have to overcome gravity.", "doctor_answer": "vasovagal syncope, this is the common faint associated with a stress response of the autonomic nervous system which can either suddenly lower the pulse rate, the blood pressure or both together. It is one of the neurally-mediated reflex syncopes.\n\nFainting or syncope is a sudden (and generally momentary) loss of consciousness due to a lack of sufficient blood and oxygen reaching the brain. The first symptoms a person feels before fainting are dizziness and feeling hot. Moments later, the person's vision turns black and he or she drops to the floor (or slumps if seated in a chair).\n\nFactors that influence fainting are taking in too little food and fluids, low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, physical exercise in excess of the energy reserve of the body, and lack of sleep. Even standing up too quickly or being in too hot a room can cause fainting.\n\nFainting involves a temporary reduction of blood (and therefore oxygen) supply to the brain, resulting in a blackout. Many forms of syncope are benign and easy to associate with clear precipitants that can be avoided. Such precipitants can include many common situations and recreational drugs as well as therapeutic drugs."}

{"question": "Can a person really live without any kidneys?", "patient_answer": "No atleast we need one\n\nThe kidney is a very important organ, and the most obvious function is that it excretes wastes that we produce from our diet and from our metabolism. What's less obvious is that it's the most important organ that controls the composition of the body fluids. In addition, it does produce a number of hormones that deal with body function. \n\n\nThe kidney is a filtering organ, so blood is delivered to a very unique apparatus in the kidney called the glomerulus, and there, because of pressure dynamics, a component of the blood is filtered across the membrane, and the first process of creating the urine develops. In this segment of the kidney, in the glomerulus, the composition of that fluid is very similar to blood. The fluid passes through a series of tubules in a structure called the nephron, and there it's modified, heavily modified. A variety of things are reabsorbed that we need, and a variety of toxins are concentrated until the end of the kidney, the end of that nephron segment, drains into something called a papilla, then into the ureter, and then the bladder, and we have what we term \"urine,\" which is a fluid rich in toxic wastes that is excreted. \n\nsuppose you drink a bottle of orange juice. The body sees a sudden excess of an element called potassium, so the kidney has sensors which look at the body fluid going through the kidney as plasma, and it detects that the plasma's potassium has gone up, and it immediately increase the excretion of potassium so everything comes back to normal.", "doctor_answer": "A person can live very well without kidneys, given the use of dialysis as an alternative.  However, the lifespan of a person requiring dialysis is significantly shorter than a normal person, because of increased risk of infection, vascular disease and complications like heart disease and stroke.  Without dialysis, survival would not be possible at all."}

{"question": "how do people get lint stuck in thier belly button?", "patient_answer": "When I was young (perhaps four or five) I had heard a reference to \"belly button lint.\" For some unbeknownst reason, this phenomenon terrified me more than I can possibly say. I was horrified of the thought of having lint in my belly button, and became convinced that if I NEVER let my belly button be uncovered, the lint would have no way of sneaking in. All of my night-shirts were streched out on the bottoms because I would draw my knees up to my chest and pin the bottom of the shirts to the floor with my hands. I even attempted to tape over my belly button when bathing,but after several unsuccessful tries, I concluded that the flowing water would scare away any renegade lint.

{"question": "do you agree in mercy killing?", "patient_answer": "i agree!!\n\nEuthanasia (Greek: ευθανασία - ευ \"good\", θανατος \"death\") refers to assisted dying. The assistance ends the life of a person or an animal, in a painless or minimally painful way. Euthanasia is most often performed in a merciful way, in order to end suffering. This article discusses euthanasia in humans; a separate article covers animal euthanasia.\n\nThis topic is often highly-charged—emotionally, politically, and morally. Terminology and laws shift over time and geographically and globally, causing a great deal of confusion.\n\nFirstly there is some debate as to whether euthanasia refers to \"letting die\" or \"allowing to die.\" (See terms: informed consent, decisional capacity, surrogate decision making, Living wills, Do Not Resuscitate) In the United States and the Netherlands, \"letting die\" or \"allowing to die\" refer to areas which the state consider ethically and legally acceptable and permissible. This includes the withholding and withdrawing of medical treatment such as dialysis or feeding tubes or hydration and nutrition. The last two being things which are associated with \"love and caring\" in most cultures. While the concept of holding off on those two things may be counterintuitive, as a body's major organ systems try to shut down, a dying person often feels most comfortable without any fluids or food. To do otherwise is like \"force feeding\" a body that does not \"want\" or need to be fed or hydrated, and doing so may actually cause physical discomfort and suffering.\n\nIn the UK this is usually only accepted when a newly born baby is born with certain physical or mental disorders.\n\nIn most other countries removing or denying treatment would usually be seen as murder. Usually, because in a growing number of law cases over the last 20 years, the jury has sided with the defendant.\n\nNext are several summary statements defining what euthanasia can include,. These are followed by expanded definitions of each. Euthanasia (assisted dying) may employ methods that are either indirect or direct. Indirect methods of euthanasia are defined by a individual him or herself taking the final step inducing death. Direct methods are defined by the involvement of others (clinicians) who take the final step inducing death. Direct euthanasia can either be voluntary, nonvoluntary or involuntary. (See Karl Binding and Alfred Hoche for one of the first uses of the three types of euthanasia.)\n\nIndirect euthanasia involves the indirect involvement of a clinician (e.g. physician, clinical nurse practitioner, pharmacist) as an agent who participates only by providing the means for a patient to induce his/her own death. This could mean writing or filling a prescription for medications in a quantity large enough to cause death when taken by the patient. This kind of assistance is currently legal in the American state of Oregon. It became legal in 1998 as a result of the \"Death with Dignity Act\" which was passed in the state in 1994. In politically and emotionally loaded terms, this is frequently referred to as physician-assisted suicide.\n\nDirect euthanasia involves the direct involvement of a clinician as agent in inducing a patient’s death. (e.g. administering a lethal drug by injection.) Direct euthanasia is not currently legal anywhere in the US, but both direct and indirect euthanasia are legal in Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nVoluntary euthanasia occurs with the fully-informed request of a decisionally-competent adult patient or that of their surrogate (proxy). (Example: Thomas Youk, with ALS was assisted by Jack Kevorkian.)\n\nA large part of the controversy surrounding euthanasia focuses upon the slippery slope argument. The fear is that indirect euthanasia and/or voluntary direct euthanasia will lead to acceptance of the nonvoluntary and involuntary types of euthanasia.\n\nNonvoluntary euthanasia", "doctor_answer": "i dont. i believe life is a gift from God nd only He has the right to take it back. simple as that."}

{"question": "What is the best medication to fight Multiple Sclerosis?", "patient_answer": "Three types of medications that can reduce the frequency of relapses and possibly slow down the progression of MS have been approved. This is called disease-modifying therapy, and the medications include: \n* Interferon beta (Avonex, Betaseron, and Rebif).\n    * Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone).\n    * Mitoxantrone (Novantrone).\n\nInterferon beta and glatiramer acetate suppress or alter the activity of the immune system. This treatment is based on evidence that MS is an autoimmune disease that results when there is an abnormal response by the immune system that causes it to attack normal tissues—in this case, the myelin coating that surrounds nerve fibers.\nAlthough these medications do not cure MS, they may reduce the overall number, frequency, and severity of relapses in some people who have the relapsing-remitting MS. They may also reduce or delay disability with this type of MS. Betaseron and Novantrone may slow disease progression in some people with secondary progressive MS.\nYou want to stay away from anything that Kevin Trudeau has that the below poster states- the guy is a fraud.", "doctor_answer": "Holy christmas (literally!)... the last poster, be careful.\n\nI was diagnosed in 1999.  I didn't start taking medications until 2004 (had a bit of denial there)...\nI got a flare-up that forced me to think harder about my future (and a great fiance to boot!).\n\nA lot of people go on the interferons, and Glatiramer acetate, which is what I'm on.  When I decided what to go on, I thought about what I'd have to do for it.  I was a bit worried about giving myself a shot, and I figured that I would need to have the least intrusive method of medication delivery... so I decided subcutaneous (just under the skin).  That cut down the list of interferons... \n\nThen I thought about side effects, a lot of the interferons have flu like symptoms.  When I started the meds, I was feeling weak, pins and needly, and limpy.  I said, do I want to have a cold on top of that.  No siree.\n\nI mean, you really have to talk to your NEURO, and what (s)he recommends.  It just so happened that the first NEURO in 1999, recommended Avonex as he was drinking out of an Avonex branded mug (no foolin!).  That is what turned me off from the med idea in the first place.  My SECOND neuro, he asked me my concerns, and we decided on Copaxone.  Yes, it's daily, but it's under the skin, and it just has local reactions for me as a side effect.\n\nI WAS PETRIFIED of giving myself these shots.  Many of the companies (my drugs, included) have autojectors, so you don't even have to see the needle.  Copaxone (or my doctor, I can't remember, it was so long ago!)... required me to have a home care nurse there the first time to show me how to administer the drugs.  I gave it to myself without hesitation the first time!  I am a little wary of someone else doing it (though she had recommended that my fiance learn how, too).\n\nResult?  Well, there's not much to say!  (that's a good thing)... my original symptoms had faded, and I don't know if that was the copaxone or what.  I've been on it since 2/2004 (wow!  going on 2 years soon!), and I have NO NEW LESIONS!  boy, that's more exciting than I thought it was going to be.\n\nNow, your milage WILL vary, and unlike my first time experience, you will LIKELY have to go through a few drugs to find one you like.\n\nGood luck to you!"}

{"question": "cold hands and feet...?", "patient_answer": "Cold hands and feet probably is Raynaud's syndrome, and people who have it have it in differing degrees. \n\nI used to have it pretty badly and what has warmed my hands and feet considerably is taking once daily ONE 100-mg Dilantin capsule (phenytoin sodium).\n\nDilantin is a long-established, anti-seizure drug that has many other uses, too. It works by balancing the sodium/potassium pump at the cellular level. In low doses it is a very safe mood regulator, even long-term indefinitely - and this is why I started taking it (I do not have seizures of any kind). For me Dilantin works better than any antidepressant I ever tried (and I'd been prescribed several), with no weight gain, and also Dilantin has made me need less sleep than previously. \n\nThat it warmed my hands and feet, too, was an unlooked-for-but-VERY-welcome side benefit.\n\nFor a good read and good info on low-dose Dilantin's many uses please read, \"A Remarkable Medicine Has Been Overlooked\" by Jack Dreyfus (ISBN 0-8264-1069-3). \n\nDilantin is the only med I take regularly now (I hate most meds), and I've taken it entirely voluntarily since May 1998. It definitely has changed my life for the better.\n\nWhatever you decide about trying Dilantin (and if you decide yes you'll need a doctor's prescription if you are in the United States), I do hope you solve the cold hands and feet problem, it is SUCH an inconvenience.\n\nHappy Holidays :)", "doctor_answer": "Most likely there is nothing wrong with you.  Some people have better circulation in their extremeties than others.   \n\nIt could be a medical problem, but probably not.... just genetic.    \n\nAdditional information is available in the reference below and some suggestions on how to get your hands and feet warmer.\n\nIf you are concerned, however, you should see your doctor."}

{"question": "Which is more important, counting calories or counting carbs?", "patient_answer": "It is a mistake to believe that either of those methods will help you loose weight or be healthier.  You need to see a dietician and get a balanced diet based on your very own situation.  No single method can work for every one.\n\nMy dietician asked me questions about what I eat and what I like. She measured and weighed me to determine my \"frame\".  She then explained the whole food into energy process with a simple diagram, and created a diet just for me, with all the foods I like, in the proper amounts.", "doctor_answer": "The theory behind the Atkins diet is that the way the body stores fat requires the processing of carbohydrates to store the fat. If there are no or low carbs present, you can eat all the fat you want and never gain a pound. Really. Your body has no way of producing the chemical reactions necessary to store the fat, so it just ends up getting filtered out of your blood stream. The problem is, carbs are in everything! Anyone with enough self-discipline to cut out enough carbs to make this work also has the self-discipline to eat healthy, light meals on a regular basis.\n\nThe Atkins diet works for someone who wants to be able to eat as much as they feel like, but has the good sense to keep their cupboards and fridge carb-free.\n\nI think the best answer is to stop counting anything and instead turn your fixation on something external, which includes a contribution to your health. \n\nGood luck!"}

I was cautioned to give the exercised muscles a day of rest following activity--do upper body training Monday, then lower body Tuesday, etc.\n\nAs I recall, they advocated doing cardio first, since the benefits of the activity would likely carry over into the strength training--your would likely continue receiving aerobic benefits since your heart rate would remain elevated.", "doctor_answer": "Do your cardio first because you tire out when doing weights first.

So if you take it while you're not sick, it decreases your chances of getting sick because your immune system becomes better equipped to fight illnesses. However if you're already sick, it won't have any effect on your cold.\n\nIf you're trying to shorten a cold, try zinc, usually sold in tablets. Zinc works with your system to help it fight colds, and will actually help shorten the length of it.", "doctor_answer": "A medical study by Taylor et al. (2003) demonstrated that echinacea products made from the entire plant (not just the root), and taken after the second cold symptom appeared, provided no measurable beneficial effect for children in treating the severity or duration of symptoms caused by the common cold virus. Studies by the University of Virginia School of Medicine (Turner, 2005) confirmed these results, and added that Echinacea had no clinically significant effects on the common cold even if taken immediately upon infection, or as a prophylaxis starting a week prior to symptoms of infection. However, it should be noted that this study was criticized for using lower than recommended doses and utilizing a lesser researched variant of the root that is commonly sold as a dietary supplement."}

{"question": "Why is my hair falling out?", "patient_answer": "Causes of Excessive Hair Loss\n\nThe rate of hair shedding in androgenic alopecia is speeded up by three forces: advancing age, an inherited tendency to bald early, and an over-abundance of the male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) within the hair follicle. DHT is a highly active form of testosterone, which influences many aspects of manly behavior, from sex drive to aggression. \n\nThe conversion from testosterone to DHT is driven by an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase, which is produced in the prostate, various adrenal glands, and the scalp. Over time, the action of DHT causes the hair follicle to degrade and shortens the anagen phase. Thought the follicle is technically still alive and connected to a good blood supply--it can successfully nurture a transplanted follicle which is immune to the effects of DHT--it will grow smaller and smaller (figure 3). Some follicles will gradually die, but most will simply shrink to the size they were when you were born which produce weaker hairs. With a steadily shorter anagen growing cycle, more hairs are shed, the hairs becoming thinner and thinner until they are too fine to survive daily wear and tear. Balding hair gradually changes from long, thick, coarse, pigmented hair into fine, unpigmented vellus sprouts. \n\nHowever, the sebaceous gland attached to it remains the same size. As the hair shafts become smaller, the gland continues to pump out about the same amount of oil. So as your hair thins, you will notice that your hair becomes flatter and oilier. \n\nBut the hormonal link in balding is complex. Eunuchs, who produce no testosterone, never go bald -- even if carrying a baldness gene. However, if castrated men with a family history of baldness are given testosterone, they lose hair in the classic horseshoe-shaped pattern. \n\nStudies show that while balding men don't have higher than average circulating testosterone levels, they do possess above-average amounts of a powerful testosterone derivative, dihydrotestosterone in the scalp follicles. In male balding, genetically primed follicles convert circulating testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which successively diminishes or miniaturizes follicle size, producing ever weaker hairs. With a steadily shorter anagen growing cycle, more hairs are shed, the hairs becoming thinner and thinner until they are too fine to survive daily wear and tear. Balding hair gradually changes from long, thick, coarse, pigmented hair into fine, depigmented vellus sprouts. \n\nOther physiological factors might cause hair loss. Recently, a group of Japanese researcher reported a correlation between excessive sebum in the scalp and hair loss. Excessive sebum often accompanying thinning hair is attributed to an enlargement of the sebaceous gland. They believed excessive sebum causes an high level of 5-alpha reductase and pore clogging, thus malnutrition of the hair root. \n\nAlthough this condition could be hereditary, they believe diet is a more prominent cause. The researchers note that Japanese hair was thick and healthy, with a small gland and little scalp oil, until the occidental habit of consuming animal fat crept into their diet after World War II. This change has led to a significant height increase in the Japanese population, but it has also resulted in more Japanese men losing hair. To some extent, their observation makes sense since problems with greasy hair have often been noted as much as six months to a year prior to when thinning hair becomes noticeable, but this might be just one of the symptoms, not underlying cause, more research is needed. Most doctors agree that if you have a oily scalp with thinning hair, frequent shampooing is advised. shampooing can reduce surface sebum, which contains high levels of testosterone and DHT that may reenter the skin and affect the hair follicle.", "doctor_answer": "have blood test you could have a over or under active thyroid."}

I was probably correct in believing that, also.  I was depressed. I was full of anxiety. I didn't like to meet people or even be around people.

Marijuana is slowly being recognized as a better treatment for anxiety and depression than MAOI's, SSRI's, and tri-cyclic antidepressants."}
{"question": "I was never allergic to shrimp. Now out of nowhere I am. How and why did that happen?", "patient_answer": "No one is ever allergic to something the first time they are exposed to something. The repeated exposures to something causes your body to build up antibodies. Eventually, after several exposures, your body has built up enough antibodies towards this substance, and you have an allergic reaction. Also: the common allergy to shell fish is really an allergy to iodine. So try to avoid iodine until you can see an allergist so you can determine what you are and are not allergic to.Here's a personal story: I have had to take the antibiotic Bactrim several times throughout my life. All of a sudden, I was on it again and was taking my 6th dose for that round and I went into anaphalactic shock and almost died.", "doctor_answer": "Something else to watch out for - some OTC \"weight loss\" pills are basically ground shrimp shells, and will cause a reaction."}

{"question": "what is prolactaine?", "patient_answer": "Prolactin is a hormone synthesised and secreted by lactotrope cells in the adenohypophysis (anterior pituitary gland). Prolactin is made up of 199 amino acids, and has a molecular weight of about 23,000 daltons. Prolactin has many effects, the most significant of which is to stimulate the mammary glands to produce milk (lactation).\n\nIncreased serum prolactin during pregnancy causes enlargement of the mammary glands of the breasts and increases the production of milk. However, the high levels of estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy acts directly on the breasts to stop ejection of milk. It is only when the levels of these hormones fall after child birth that milk ejection is possible.\n\nSometimes, newborn babies (males as well as females) secrete a milky substance from their nipples. This substance is called Witch's milk. This is caused by the fetus' being affected by prolactin circulating in the mother just before birth, and usually stops soon after birth", "doctor_answer": "Hormone that stimulates and maintains the secretion of milk,..

{"question": "What are the health benefits of gingko biloba?", "patient_answer": "Medical uses\nThe extract of the Ginkgo leaves contains flavonoid glycosides and ginkgolides and has been used pharmaceutically. It has many alleged properties, but is mainly used as memory enhancer and anti-vertigo agent. However, studies differ about its efficacy.\n\nIt is commonly added to energy drinks, but it is expensive, so the amount is typically so low it does not produce a noticeable effect, except for the placebo effect from being listed on the label. A study published in the August 21, 2002 issue of Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) suggests that there is no difference between the memory abilities of people taking ginkgo supplements and those taking a placebo.\n\nSide effects\nGinkgo may have some undesirable effects, especially for individuals with blood circulation disorders and those taking anti-coagulants such as aspirin and warfarin, although recent studies have found that ginkgo has little or no effect on the anticoagulant properties or pharmacodynamics of warfarin[1][2]. It should also not be used by people who are taking the anti-depressant drugs known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or by pregnant women.\n\nGinkgo side effects and cautions include increased risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and restlessness. Ginkgo should also not be used by pregnant women or people with a blood clotting disorder.\n\nIf any side effects are experienced the dosage should be lowered immediately. Ginkgo supplements are usually taken in the range of 40-200 mg per day. If the side effects continue usage should be stopped completely.\n\nTinnitus:\n\nTreatment\nSome types of tinnitus can be treated while others are permanent. In general, there are no cures specific to tinnitus, but if it is caused by a physical condition that can be treated, the tinnitus may also resolve. Chronic tinnitus can be quite stressful psychologically as it distracts the affected individual from mental tasks and interferes with sleep, particularly when there is no external sound. The affected individual may have to generate artificial noise that masks the tinnitus sound. A combination of external masking and psychological counseling known as tinnitus retraining therapy is widely practiced. While it does not actually cure the tinnitus, many report that it becomes much less disturbing and easier to ignore.", "doctor_answer": "According to research, gingko is particularly useful for circulatory problems because it works to regulate the tone and elasticity of blood vessels, increasing blood flow to the brain and extremities. Gingko also delivers a boost to the nervous system by stimulating the transmission of extra oxygen and glucose to blood cells. Additionally, gingko performs as a powerful antioxidant by scavenging harmful free radicals and aiding in the maintenance of cells. Gingko biloba can help to relieve depression, headaches, anxiety, tinnitus, and dizziness, while promoting both memory and mental clarity. Controlled studies have shown gingko, which stimulates blood flow to the brain, can improve memory in some people with Alzheimer's disease. It can also be useful in the treatment of symptoms from such conditions as Raynaud's disease, macular degeneration, cataracts, impotence, and asthma. Furthermore, gingko is beneficial in the treatment of complications of diabetes, and helps to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke.\nIf you go to http://www.holistic-online.com/Remedies/Ear/tin_alt_herbal-medicine.htm it gives herbs for tinnitus including a description."}

{"question": "explain to me more bout hydrocephalus?", "patient_answer": "Hydrocephalus is the build-up of pressure in the brain due to an excessive accumulation of cerebral spinal fluid. It may result from genetic abnormalities or injuries. It does tend to happen more in children, but it does happen in adults and there is a condition called \"normal pressure hydrocephaly\" that occurs in the elderly that can be mistaken for dementia.\n\nUntreated, persons can have brain damage or death. There is a very successul treatment, often surgically implanting a drain (called a shunt) that drains off excess fluid. Early treatment is very important.\n\nSee resources below.", "doctor_answer": "To tag on to PsychProf:\n\nFluid washes over the brain and drains out.  BUT, when it cannot drain normally, the fluid can build up.  In a baby, the head might physically enlarge. \n\nBecause adults have a solid skull, the fluid pressure build up tends to compress the brain tissue.  While surgery is an option (and fairly effective), a typicaly outcome is preventing the problem becoming worse.\n\nIf you suspect this in an adult (especially one beginning to display dementia and who had some significant blows to the head), a CT scan might be in order."}

SHOULD I TAKE THEM AGAIN", "patient_answer": "The word \"bipolar\" is simply a label used to categorise a list of psychosocial traits that Psychiatry considers to be improper or abnormal in society. Psychiatry defines these traits as a \"mental illness\", and promotes it as a \"disease\" that requires \"treatment\".\n\nIt is not a \"disease\", despite claims or implications made by certain psychiatric or pharmaceutical organisations. There is NO credible scientific evidence that shows the existence of what constitutes \"bipolar\" as a biological/neurological disorder, brain abnormality or \"chemical imbalance\".\n\n\"For a disease to exist there must be a tangible, objective physical abnormality that can be determined by a test such as, but not limited to, blood or urine test, X-Ray, brain scan or biopsy. All reputable doctors would agree: No physical abnormality, no disease. In psychiatry, no test or brain scan exists to prove that a 'mental disorder' is a physical disease. Disingenuous comparisons between physical and mental illness and medicine are simply part of psychiatry's orchestrated but fraudulent public relations and marketing campaign.\" Fred Baughman, MD., Neurologist & Pediatric Neurologist.\n\n\"Chemical imbalance…it’s a shorthand term really, it’s probably drug industry derived… We don’t have tests because to do it, you’d probably have to take a chunk of brain out of someone - not a good idea.\" Dr. Mark Graff, Chair of the Committee of Public Affairs for the American Psychiatric Association. July, 2005.\n\nSymptoms that psychiatry labels as \"bipolar\" (or it's related disorders), can stem from any number of variable sources. Many people, for example, have overcome \"bipolar\" through megavitamin therapy and effective nutrition. A growing wealth of evidence supports that underlying nutritional deficiencies can cause even the most severe mental disorders, including symptoms labelled as \"schizophrenia\" [See source refs]\n\nBottom line? Psychiatry is a belief-system, a \"faith\", not a science. Despite the huge marketing strategies, the so-called \"research\" and all the propaganda thrown at the world, there is not one iota of scientific evidence that proves that \"schizophrenia\" or ANY mental illness, in fact, exists as an actual --medical disease--.\n\nIf you have been told differently then know this: You have been lied to.\n\nFor more information, please visit:\n\nhttp://groups.msn.com/psychbusters\nDecoding Psychiatric Propaganda\n\nFor information on non-drug / alternative approaches:\n- http://www.alternativementalhealth.com/articles/default.htm#B\n- http://www.pendulum.org/articles/articles_misc_lisaalt.html\n- http://www.truehope.com/_empowerplus/empowerplus.asp\n- http://www.mentalhealthproject.com/content.asp?id_Content=1575", "doctor_answer": "This is a personal decision, but for me the answer to managing my bipolar is meds and therapy. After going on and off for about 2 1/2 years, and dealing with serious consequences, I finally accepted that to have the quality of life I want, I HAVE to take the drugs EVERY DAY for the rest of my life. I've been on them permanently for about 3 1/2 years now. It took a long time to adjust to being so different. At times, I feel like I've lost a bit of my identity, but the positives outweigh that. In a way, I'm MORE myself b/c I can follow through with things that are important to me and I can respect myself more for being true to who I am. When I wasn't managing the bipolar well, I'd do things that weren't \"me\" if I got too up or down. But it did take a long time on the meds to feel like this new me is the real me. I miss some of the highs, b/c I was so creative and productive. But the depressions would always undo any progress I made when up, so overall I didn't move forward with the things that are important to me. So even though the slow and steady pace I work at now seems boring, I take comfort in realizing that in the scheme of things, I'm accomplishing more."}

Examples of exocrine glands are salivary glands, mammary glands, sweat glands, gastric glands, and the prostate.

{"question": "Is there any way to treat migraines without drugs?", "patient_answer": "What usaully helps me is caffeine. Try to drink a cup of coffee, not really strong, just enough. Either with cream or sugar. Then try to relax for awhile, if you can take a nap. Hope this helps you. :-)", "doctor_answer": "yes there is, and it's called cupping\nand it's the most oldest traditional medicine.\nand the most amazing thing that most latest studies have beeen shown that it releive migarains by 80%>>>>>>\n\nHow does cupping work? What does it treat? \n\nIn a typical cupping session, glass cups are warmed using a cotton ball or other flammable substance, which is soaked in alcohol, let, then placed inside the cup. Burning a substance inside the cup removes all the oxygen, which creates a vacuum.\n\nAs the substance burns, the cup is turned upside-down so that the practitioner can place the cup over a specific area. The vacuum created by the lack of oxygen anchors the cup to the skin and pulls it upward on the inside of the glass as the air inside the jar cools. Drawing up the skin is believed to open up the skin’s pores, which helps to stimulate the flow of blood, balances and realigns the flow of qi, breaks up obstructions, and creates an avenue for toxins to be drawn out of the body.\n\nDepending on the condition being treated, the cups will be left in place from 5 to 10 minutes. Several cups may be placed on a patient’s body at the same time. Some practitioners will also apply small amounts of medicated oils or herbal oils to the skin just before the cupping procedure, which lets them move the cups up and down particular acupoints or meridians after they have been applied.\n\nIn China, cupping is used primarily to treat respiratory conditions such as bronchitis, asthma, and congestion; arthritis; gastrointestinal disorders; and certain types of pain. Some practitioners also use cupping to treat depression and reduce swelling. Fleshy sites on the body, such as the back and stomach (and, to a lesser extent, the arms and legs), are the preferred sites for treatment.\n\nHow many types of cupping are there? \nIn addition to the traditional form of cupping described above, which is known as “dry” cupping, some practitioners also use what is called “wet” or “air” cupping. \n\nIn “air” cupping, instead of using a flame to heat the cup, the cup is applied to the skin, and a suction pump is attached to the rounded end of the jar. The pump is then used to create the vacuum. In “wet” cupping, the skin is punctured before treatment. When the cup is applied and the skin is drawn up, a small amount of blood may flow from the puncture site, which are believed to help remove harmful substances and toxins from the body.\n\nIs cupping safe? Does it hurt? \nWhile cupping is considered relatively safe (especially air cupping, which does not include the risk of fire and heat), it can cause some swelling and bruising on the skin. As the skin under a cup is drawn up, the blood vessels at the surface of the skin expand. This may result in small, circular bruises on the areas where the cups were applied. These bruises are usually painless, however, and disappear within a few days of treatment.\n\nIn addition, there are several instances where cupping should not be performed. Patients with inflamed skin; cases of high fever or convulsions; and patients who bleed easily, are not suitable candidates for cupping. Pregnant women should not have cupping on their stomach or lower back. If the cups are being moved, they should not cross bony areas, such as the ridges of the spine or the shoulder blades.\n\nI would like to learn more about cupping. Where can I find out more information? \nSeveral articles on cupping have been published in peer-reviewed journals and acupuncture websites. To learn more about cupping, you are encouraged to visit the following sites and read the following articles:\n\nAlternative therapies. Cupping. A World of Acupuncture website.

{"question": "can pain happen if you receive a hit in the chest where the vagus nerve stimulator is?", "patient_answer": "You may feel pain, but it is not due to the vagus nerve.  We have many different types of nerves in the body, including motor, sensory, and autonomic.  The only nerves that send pain signals to your brain are ones that are specific for pain and are included in the \"sensory\" category.  The vagus nerve has many functions, but it is mostly an autonomic nerve, meaning it is involved in basic human functions (\"fight or flight\" response versus \"rest and digest\").\n\nSince you asked about the \"vagus nerve stimulator\", I assume you are talking about an implanted medical device designed to stimulate the vagus nerve.  Otherwise, we don't have an anatomical object in our bodies that is specifically called the vagus nerve stimulator.  If a person HAD to receive a hit in the chest, I wouldn't recommend that position, because the device could dislodge with very bad consequences.", "doctor_answer": "ummm...considering that it's a nerve, yes.  nerves after all, are what send messages to your brain that something hurts among other things.  pinched nerves are common causes of pain so if you pinched the nerve when you got hit, then it'll hurt.

In contrast, bipolar II disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and milder symptoms of mania, called hypomania. Hypomanic episodes typically do not impair an individual's ability to function to the extent that full-blown manic episodes do additionally; hypomanic episodes are not complicated by psychotic symptoms. \n\n3. What is rapid cycling? \n\nThe term rapid cycling was originally coined by David Dunner, M.D., and Ron Fieve, M.D., in the 1970s when they identified a group of individuals who did not respond well to lithium. These patients typically had four or more episodes of mania or depression in the 12-month interval prior to lithium treatment. This definition has been adopted formally by DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.) and specifically means the occurrence of four or more mood episodes within the preceding year. In severe cases, rapid cycling can occur even within a one-day period. \n\n4. At what age does bipolar disorder appear? \n\nBipolar disorder most commonly presents in the late teens and early 20s. Unfortunately, for most individuals, lifelong treatment may be required to prevent recurrent manic and depressive episodes. Equally unfortunate is evidence that the illness often goes undiagnosed and untreated for many years; the longer the illness progresses without treatment, the greater the impairment in an individual's psychological, educational and vocational development. Additionally, untreated bipolar disorder carries a high risk of suicide. \n\n5. Is bipolar disorder genetic? \n\nBipolar disorder, among all psychiatric illnesses, may have the greatest genetic contribution. For instance, if an individual has a parent with bipolar disorder, the chance that the individual's child will have bipolar disorder is about nine-fold greater than in the general population, with the risk rising from about 1% to about 10%. The inheritability of this illness is estimated to be anywhere from 50% to 80%. On the other hand, if a person with bipolar disorder is thinking about having children, there are still good odds that the child will not have bipolar illness. So the genetic determinants of the illness are complicated. \n\n6. How is bipolar disorder treated? \n\nThe cornerstone of treatment is medications that treat acute manic, depressive or mixed episodes, and which, in the long run, attempt to prevent the recurrence of these episodes. Such medications include lithium, divalproex (Depakote) and, more recently, some of the atypical antipsychotics as well as antidepressants. \n\nPsychotherapy plays an important role in improving the course and outcome of this illness in people. In particular, those with bipolar disorder often have strained relationships with loved ones because of their experiences during manic or depressive episodes; psychotherapy can help repair these torn relationships. In addition, psychotherapy can educate people about the signs and symptoms of their illness, how to pay attention to warning signs and how to nip emerging episodes in the bud. Psychotherapy can also help individuals cope with the stress that can sometimes precipitate manic or depressive episodes. \n\n7. What medications are used to treat bipolar disorder? \n\nThere are a number of medicat"}

This is the first I have heard about iron being used to lower your blood sugar levels. \nBe very careful when trying to treat your blood sugar with \"popular\" or \"unprescribed\" remedies.

{"question": "What can treat ankylosin spondolitis so that more than symptoms are addressed?", "patient_answer": "Ankylosing spondylitis is a form of arthritis that is long-lasting (chronic) and most often affects the spine. Although there is no cure, treatment can usually control symptoms and prevent the condition from getting worse.\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, there are steps that you can take at home to help reduce pain and stiffness and allow you to continue daily activities. These steps include:\n\nEducating yourself. Learn all you can about your condition and know what complications to watch for. This will help you control your symptoms and stay more active.\n \nReducing pain by taking pain relievers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or using heat to decrease your pain and stiffness. Warm showers or baths or sleeping under a warm electric blanket may reduce stiffness. \n\nExercising regularly. This reduces pain and stiffness and helps maintain fitness and mobility of the spine, chest, and joints. Your doctor may recommend physical therapy to get you started on an exercise program. \n\nDeep breathing exercises can improve or maintain lung capacity.\n\nSwimming as part of your exercise program helps to maintain chest expansion and movement of the spine without jarring the spine. Breast stroke is especially good for chest expansion. \n\nYou should avoid contact sports, since joint fusion may make your spine more likely to fracture as the disease progresses, but your doctor may approve of other activities such as golf and tennis. Check with your doctor before you add any new activity.\n \nMaintaining proper posture and chest expansion. Good posture is important because it can help prevent abnormal bending of the spine. \n\nMaintaining chest expansion will help prevent problems such as lung infection (pneumonia). It's a good idea to lie on your stomach a few times each day to keep your spine and hips extended. \n\nFor sleeping, choose a firm mattress and a small pillow that supports your neck. \n\nAvoiding smoking, to prevent serious breathing difficulties and lung scarring. Lung damage from smoking, combined with decreased chest expansion and the lung infections that sometimes go with ankylosing spondylitis, can seriously limit your ability to breathe freely. \n\n\nHaving regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist, to check for inflammation of the colored part of the eye (iritis).\n \nJoining a support group.

{"question": "Which antidepressant will not make me gain weight, and won't make me lose my libido?", "patient_answer": "Thats not a question that can be answered without the help of a psychiatrist.  Its important to understand that different individuals react differently to the same medication.  Somtimes the sexual side effects from an antidepressant are a good trade off with the overall benefits of the drug, sometimes not.  \"Stop getting off\" is a choice :-).  If your libido is comparatively low, you might not feel like indulging in sexual activity a lot, unless stimulated.  That again is a subjective thing.  Some men are prescribed antidepressants for premature ejaculation because it helps them to slow down and retain an erection for a longer time.\n\nAs far as weight is concerned, once you are \"off your butt\" you can do a lot to maintain that.  Dont expect the antidepressant to be a wonder drug but something that helps you \"for a while.\"\n\nThere are different kind of antidepressants -\n\n1.  Tricyclic antidepressants (Elavil, Endep, Anafranil, Norpramin, Pertofrane, Adapin, Sinequan, Tofranil, Aventyl, Vivactil, Surmontil)\n\n2.  Tetracyclic antidepressants (Asendin, Ludiomil).\n\n3.  SSRI antidepressants: Celexa, Prozac, Luvox, Paxil, Zoloft.\n\n4.  MAO inhibitors (Marplan, Nardil, Eldepryl, Parnate)\n\n5.  Serotonin antagonists (Serzone, Desyrel)\n\n6.  Others (Wellbutrin, Effexor, Remeron)\n\nMood stabilizers\n\nTegretol, Neurontin, Lamictal, Eskalith, Depakene, Depakote.\n\nThe most commonly used antidepressants are SSRIs with Prozac being considered almost a synonym for an antidepressant.\n\nWeight gain or loss and decreased or increased libido are not the only side effects of antidepressants.  There are other potentially dangerous side effects like muscular spasms and lethal interactions with other drugs that it makes it imperative to seek psychiatric consultation before you start on them.\n\nThe best treatment is a combination of cognitive therapy with an antidepressant.   Feeling Good by David D. Burns, M.D. is the Bible for depressed inviduals and psychiatrists themselves prescribe it to patients.  So go grab it first.  The latest version has a consumer guide for antidepressants as well.  Thats a great starting point!!!  Good luck.\n\nWould you be kind enough to rate the best answer?  I have worked hard on this question and am waiting for the results.  Thanks", "doctor_answer": "I think \"THAT'S RIGHT\" pretty much has this question answered.  I am on Paxil and Klonipin togrther and I did gain weight at first and blamed the meds, especially cuz I was a size 2/4.  I finally changed my eating habits, controlled cravings, got off my butt and exercised for the first time in my life and wa-lah!, didn't lose all the weight, but am happy with being a 4/6, and I feel better about myself and am maintaining my weight.  As far as libido, your doc can help w/this one.  I thought I was having this problem too, just because all the info said I would.  I figured out that it was just a mind set, and I actually don't have a prob w/this at all.  I don't mean to downplay this, but it might be in your head.

This has often shown abnormalities that explain (at leain part) the heart disease.", "doctor_answer": "A lot depends on the \"type\" of cholesterol a person has. The types are LDL and HDL. It's easy to discern the two because you can think of LDL as being the \"lethal\" type.\n\nBelow is an excerpt from an article on WebMD that provides better clarification about the types of cholesterol and why having low cholesterol may lead to heart attacks:\n\n\nCholesterol is transported in a person's blood in special proteins called lipoproteins. The two we are most familiar with are low-density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol). LDL is often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol. It transports cholesterol from the liver to other body tissues -- depositing excess cholesterol on the walls of arteries to form artery-clogging \"plaques\" that contribute to the development of heart disease and stroke. You want to have less of this. \n\nIn contrast, HDL, or good cholesterol, helps remove excess cholesterol from the blood -- transporting it back to the liver, where it can be eliminated from the body. You want to have more of this type. \n\nFurthermore, the latest recommendations are that LDL levels ideally be below 100 -- a significant reduction from previous recommendations -- and that HDL levels be above 40, ideally over 60."}

{"question": "how can you really really lose your baby fat?", "patient_answer": "try taboo\nWHAT to eat for losing weight\n\n• Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially NC (negative calorie) food.\n\n* Print these lists. They will be your ... \"Bible\", from now on !\n* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\n• Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\n• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\n• Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have \"low fat\" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\n• About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\n\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\n\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle \"burn\". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\n\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\n\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\n\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \n\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\n\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\n\ngood luck", "doctor_answer": "My Mom had an operation done that removed the Baby fat, however she does not recommend such an operation at all."}

{"question": "What are the symptoms of diabetes?", "patient_answer": "Type 2 diabetes almost always has a slow onset (often years), but in type 1, particularly in children, onset may be quite fast (weeks or months). Early symptoms of type 1 diabetes are often polyuria (frequent urination) and polydipsia (increased thirst, and consequent increased fluid intake). There may also be weight loss (despite normal or increased eating), increased appetite, and irreducible fatigue. These symptoms may also manifest in Type 2 diabetes in patients who present with frank poorly controlled diabetes.\n\nThirst develops because of osmotic effects — sufficiently high glucose (above the 'renal threshold') in the blood is excreted by the kidneys but this requires water to carry it and causes increased fluid loss, which must be replaced. The lost blood volume will be replaced from water held inside body cells, causing dehydration.\n\nAnother common presenting symptom is altered vision. Prolonged high blood glucose causes changes in the shape of the lens in the eye, leading to blurred vision and, perhaps, a visit to an optometrist. All unexplained quick changes in eyesight should force a fasting blood glucose test. These are now quick (less than 5 minutes total), inexpensive (materials less than USD $1), and can be safely performed by almost anyone with trivial training.\n\nEspecially dangerous symptoms in diabetics include the smell of acetone on the patient's breath (a sign of ketoacidosis), Kussmaul breathing (a rapid, deep breathing), and any altered state of consciousness or arousal (hostility and mania are both possible, as is confusion and lethargy). The most dangerous form of altered consciousness is the so-called \"diabetic coma\" which produces unconsciousness. Early symptoms of impending diabetic coma include polyuria, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, with lethargy and somnolence a later development, progressing to unconsciousness and death if untreated.", "doctor_answer": "Some diabetes symptoms include:\n\n\n    * Frequent urination\n    * Excessive thirst\n    * Extreme hunger\n    * Unusual weight loss\n    * Increased fatigue\n    * Irritability\n    * Blurry vision"}

Its kind of unheard of but should be talked about more. You can contract hpv from any skin on skin contact, yea thats right, even dry sex isn't safe anymore. As for oral sex no its not transmittable. kissing your safe too. Do know that people will still want you and still want to be with you even though you have a uncurable std. Just be sure to tell your partner before you have sex or even protected sex, because its still transmittable with a condom.  The best thing you can do for your friend is don't treat her like she has an illness. Hug her up, hell even drink after her just to let her know she's not discussting. The only way she could transmit it would be by skin on skin contact of the genitials. All kinds of people are in the same boat as your friend but just arn't as confortable with sharing.

And your still the same person as you were before just one that has to be a bit safer and picker when it comes to the bedroom.", "doctor_answer": "Genital HPV infection is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Human papillomavirus is the name of a group of viruses that includes more than 100 different strains or types. More than 30 of these viruses are sexually transmitted, and they can infect the genital area of men and women including the skin of the penis, vulva (area outside the vagina), or *nus, and the linings of the vagina, cervix, or rectum. Most people who become infected with HPV will not have any symptoms and will clear the infection on their own. But the virus is always in your body, so it can come back.\n\nSome of these viruses are called \"high-risk\" types, and may cause abnormal Pap tests. They may also lead to cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, *nus, or penis. Others are called \"low-risk\" types, and they may cause mild Pap test abnormalities or genital warts.

{"question": "what do doctors think about Z Coil shoes?", "patient_answer": "Docter Erwin Linzner shares his insights on Z-CoiL® Pain Relief Footwear™ and good posture: \n\nGood posture is an important strategy in protecting your spine and preventing soft tissue injuries, such as postural strains. Whether you are a nurse that is constantly on your feet, or a secretary that spends hours behind a desk and performs data entry, poor posture will inevitably lead to musculo-skeletal injury and pain. It therefore behooves all of us to use good posture in our daily activities, such as sitting, standing and walking. \n\nIdeal posture is basically that body configuration that requires the minimal amount of energy to keep us seated or upright. Once you deviate from that position, certain muscle groups get fatigued and problems will result. For instance, if you are a secretary, and you do not use a headset, and you consistently tilt your head to the side to approximate the head to the phone, you are going to have neck pain. A chronically tilted head requires your lateral flexors of the neck to work overtime, resulting in sprains/strains. \n\nWhile standing, our base support starts with our feet. Our spine by design has several curvatures to maximize our ability to balance, and at the same time minimizes the amount of energy required to maintain this posture. High heels, as worn by many women, of course forcibly deviates your body’s curvatures from ideal, leading to back pain, knee pain, and foot pain. An innovative new product on the market, called Z-Coil shoes, may actually help improve your posture. These shoes were actually designed to prevent foot, back, and leg pain. These shoes have a built-in orthotic, a rocker-bottom forefoot neoprene sole, and a metal coil under the heel for maximum shock absorption. Advantages of these shoes include impact reduction, stimulation of the balancing system due to the elasticity of the coil. \n\nThe loss of the ability to coordinate our muscles for balancing is one of the main reasons seniors fall and sustain hip fractures. I believe, Z-Coils may actually help in maintaining our balancing system, which of course involves the brain. This would be due to the fact that the coil has a give on impact, which forces you to work on your balance. Better balance, less impact on the back from standing, may help your posture, especially if there already is pain and inflammation in the affected area of the spine. \n\nSince 1994, Doctor Erwin Linzner has managed a chiropractic practice in Rohnert Park, California.

{"question": "is it possible that i will have a lead mark under my skin after a blunt pencil was thrown at my forehead?", "patient_answer": "kind of.  these days, pencils are made of graphite, which is not harmful like lead is.  it can get caught under the skin, in which case you'll have a blackish gray mark underneath the surface indefinitely (i have one on my thumb).", "doctor_answer": "My brother and I were playing with a pencil (?!) when I was in high school.\n\nTwenty *mumblemumble* years later the spot is still there."}

{"question": "How can I speed the healing of a jammed/sprained toe?", "patient_answer": "Well, if you have iced it for the first 24 hours and the swelling has stopped, it is time to get the blood flowing through there to speed up the healing process.  So now it is time to start adding heat for short periods of time.  Alternated with ice, you can expect to recover a little faster.  As you know, it's hard to splint a toe, but taping it to your other toe may ease the pain of putting on a sock.  If swelling persists, make sure you keep it elevated above the heart as much as possible.", "doctor_answer": "Good luck, I tripped over an extension cord 6 months ago and I think I broke my big toe and it still hurts and I can't bend it like I can on my other foot.  Toes are tricky because you can't really set them, so you have to let them heal on their own.  Don't baby it too much, I think that's what my problem is. It also caused pain in my arch from babying it and trying to take pressure and weight off it when I walked.  I've heard that if it's broken it will be almost instantly blue/black, but mine wasn't.  It did bruise halfway up the top of my foot though."}

{"question": "Should a 36 year old woman who has had a tubal ligation have a regular monthly menstral cycle?", "patient_answer": "yes- as you are still ovulating despite the tubal.  All a tubal does is scar the fallopian tubes, which is the passage way for the egg to the uterus, so it has nothing to do with the ovary, which is where the egg comes from.", "doctor_answer": "Yes, having your tubes tied does not affect your cycle.  A lining still forms in your uterus and needs to shed if not needed (during a pregnancy).  Also I'd like to point out to you that if the procedure did not include cutting and burning the tubes and they were simply \"tied\", they could come undone.  I had mine done in 1997 and found myself preganant in 2001.  When I asked how that could be the explantion was my tubes were just tied and had come undone.  For permanency they should have been cut and burned.  I did not know there was a difference.  Be careful if that is your case."}

{"question": "Is Eczema a disease or just a condition?", "patient_answer": "It is considered a condition.", "doctor_answer": "It is an Illness!\n\nAll western and some eastern medicine will diagnose this as a \"condition\" because they are trained only to treat the symptoms and not the cause.  They bombard you with creams and ointments and just push the problem deeper and deeper into your system.  Believe me, because of this nonsense, I've been made to suffer for years with this illness due to their love of money and the secrets that the FDA hides from the public.  \n\nI am currently going through a rough time in my life now with it and I am currently trying a cleanse.  Although I've sent out a simular question to this site, I'm still convinced that the problem lies within my intestines. I'm just curious to see what other people have to say about it....\n\nRecently they believe that people like us suffer from a parasite that lives within our intestines.  We then share our body with it and have to deal with the consiquences.  \n\nKeep in mind that this problem is VERY resilient and could take months to cure. Believe me I know! I'm currently unemployed because of it. I was a massage therapist and I have completely lost the use of my hands due to the itching and cracking of my fingers....\n\nRegardless.....if you do decide to go with this program....I recommend these folks over any of the others....they are very helpful on the phone with any questions that (YOU WILL HAVE) during your cleanse......The product is called \"Threelac\".\n\nMuch success and good luck to you!\n\n:)\nPeace!"}

{"question": "What is the best diet for someone who wants to lose 10-15 lbs.?", "patient_answer": "One pound of fat=3,500 calories, so if you reduce your caloric intake by 500 calories a day (which should be pretty easy), you'll lose a lb a week of fat.  If you encorporate exercise into the program, you'll lose even more.  However, the exercise may increase your muscle mass, so you should go by inches not lbs when noting the weight loss, since muscle weighs more than fat.  I've been there done that and it works well, if you have the motivation and perseverence to follow through for the long term.  Also, drink LOTS of water, it is a natural diuretic and helps flush the system , imagine that, water helping to get rid of excess water.  There are no miracle pills that will give you the weight loss without work and becoming anorexic or bulemic isn't a good idea, unless you are on a suicide mission.", "doctor_answer": "I have lost over 83 pounds by doing this. In all honesty, just start counting your calories, and lowering your portion sizes. All of the fad diets have harmful side effects that can harm your body, why 9 out of 10 doctors agree that calorie counting is the best way to loose weight.\n\nIt won't be easy, but if it was, wouldn't everyone be little?\n\nYou just have to decide, do I want this piece of Cheesecake, or that new dress in a smaller size.\n-daniel"}
{"question": "If pharmaceutical companies had a cure for some or all types of cancer, and other diseases should they be?", "patient_answer": "Drug makers can not and should not be held accountable for not putting a drug on the market--no matter what kind of benefit it might provide.\n\nDrug companies have too often done the opposite--put drugs into the marketplace that turned out to NOT be the \"miracle\" they were claimed to be.  No matter how much testing or research is done, there is never enough evidence initally to guarantee either success or the lack of  an unexpected side effect.", "doctor_answer": "Pharmaceutical companies have no obligations to save lives even if they have the technology.  They have no obligation to go out of their way to help anyone, but it is certainly nice when they do.\n\nPeople should go to jail for hurting you, not for not helping you.

{"question": "what is the best medication to take for copd?", "patient_answer": "Like any medication, there is rarely a best.  Each person reacts differently to different medications.  Medications are usually judged on two major criteria: safety (ie. Does it give any harmful side effects?) and efficacy (Does it actually make you feel better?).  Your doctor will be the best person to talk to in order to decide on which medication is best for you.  \n\nThere are a number of medications that are available for COPD.  There are bronchodilators such as Ventolin (salbutamol), Serevent(salmeterol), and the newest Spiriva(tiotropium bromide)- these generally are used to relieve shortness of breath and open up the airways to the lungs.  There are long-acting and short-acting bronchodilators.  This is the largest class of drugs used for COPD.\n\nThere are oral (prednisone) or inhaled corticosteroids, including Flovent (fluticasone), Pulmicort (budesonide).  These are more for treating inflammation in the lungs, and only help a small portion of COPD sufferers.  This class of drugs was first developed to treat asthma patients, which is a different pathology.  New research, however, shows that there are more common elements to asthma and COPD than pulmonologists had once believed.  As such, they are seeing that some COPDers benefit from asthma medications.\n\nThere have been studies that link COPD to an inflammatory response via the phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) pathway and new drugs are currently being tested that could make it to market.  Ariflo (cilomilast) is the drug that is the closest to being approved, with other drug candidates coming from Bayer and Byk Gulden also being developed.  If your COPD is relatively advanced, and your quality of life has not improved greatly, PDE-4 medications may offer an alternative.  However, one compound from Merck was discontinued due to safety concerns because the drug caused one case of colitis.  \n\nMuch like all drugs, one must seriously weigh the benefits and risks.  This is an exercise best performed with a trained physician or pulmonologist.  Best of luck.", "doctor_answer": "Severals treatments can be used in conjunction with each other.  Nebulizer treatments and/or MDIs (Measured dose inhalers) with bronchodilators such as Albuterol, Xopenex, mixed with Atovent... Inhalers with the same meds, also  Advair, Flovent, several others are excellent.  Sometimes it is trial and error to see what works for you.  If there is difficulty loosening secreations, than I would recommend a percusser vest and/or a flutter valve. Stay away from people with flu/infection...get your flu shot every year.  Find your own pace and stick with it.  Over taxing yourself in spurts will deplete your oxygen and overwork your heart. If you smoke...STOP.  If you don't smoke, do NOT let people smoke around you.  Eat small, frequent meals and get exercise.  Good nutrition and strong muscles will help you breath better.  Use a humidifier in your home, especially during sleep. Cool (not cold)humidified air is healthier than hot and/or dry air.\nIf you get a cold/flu, see your doctor promptly....do NOT use the thinking you'll get through it.  The earlier the treatment, the quicker you'll get through the problem!!!!  You may be on steroids orally everyday or in an acute respiratory episode.  If you have been on a certain medication for a long time, you doctor may change the medication.  It may be the same type of medication, but the differences in the meds may be more effective....trial & error....."}

As a positive influence, stress can help compel us to action; it can result in a new awareness and an exciting new perspective. As a negative influence, it can result in feelings of distrust, rejection, anger, and depression, which in turn can lead to health problems such as headaches, upset stomach, rashes, insomnia, ulcers, high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.

{"question": "Why do we yawn?", "patient_answer": "Aparantly there are three theories as to why we yawn\n\nThe Physiological Theory -- Our bodies induce yawning to drawn in more oxygen or remove a build-up of carbon dioxide. This theory helps explain why we yawn in groups. Larger groups produce more carbon dioxide, which means our bodies would act to draw in more oxygen and get rid of the excess carbon dioxide. However, if our bodies make us yawn to drawn in needed oxygen, wouldn't we yawn during exercise? Robert Provine, a psychologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and a leading expert on yawning, has tested this theory. Giving people additional oxygen didn't decrease yawning and decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide in a subject's environment also didn't prevent yawning. \nThe Evolution Theory -- Some think that yawning is something that began with our ancestors, who used yawning to show their teeth and intimidate others. An offshoot of this theory is the idea that yawning developed from early man as a signal for us to change activities. \nThe Boredom Theory -- In the dictionary, yawning is said to be caused by boredom, fatigue or drowsiness. Although we do tend to yawn when bored or tired, this theory doesn't explain why Olympic athletes yawn right before they compete in their event. It's doubtful that they are bored with the world watching them", "doctor_answer": "\"While the dictionary tells us that yawning is caused by being fatigued, drowsy or bored, scientists are discovering that there is more to yawning than what most people think. Not much is known about why we yawn or if it serves any useful function, and very little research has been done on the subject. However, there are several theories about why we yawn.\"\n\nSee the source link for more."}

{"question": "Did anybody come across this disease call Pins And Needles?", "patient_answer": "Pins and needles\n \n  \n\n'Pins and needles' (paraesthesia) is a sensation of uncomfortable tingling or prickling, usually felt in the hands or feet. The affected area is sometimes said to have 'fallen asleep'. A common cause is leaning or lying awkwardly on a limb, which either presses against the nerves or reduces the blood supply to the local area. Changing position quickly restores normal feeling. Any numbness is soon replaced by the tingling and prickling sensation, as the nerves start sending messages again to the brain and spinal cord. In some cases, pins and needles are caused by nerve damage or certain disorders of the central nervous system. Always see your doctor if you experience frequent or persistent bouts of pins and needles.\n\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of pins and needles include:\n\n    * Hands and feet are usually affected\n    * Initial numbness and heaviness\n    * Prickling and tingling sensation on the skin\n    * Return of normal feeling a few minutes after changing position.\n\nA range of causes\nPins and needles can be caused by a wide range of events and conditions, including:\n\n    * Pressure on nerves\n    * Reduced blood supply\n    * Nerve injury\n    * Hyperventilation or breathing excessively\n    * The effect of toxic substances on the nerves, such as alcohol or lead\n    * Certain medications\n    * Diabetes\n    * Multiple sclerosis\n    * Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland)\n    * Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA)\n    * Stroke.", "doctor_answer": "This is not a disease as far as I know.

You may have no intention of becoming a father just yet, but it is always best to prepare for the future. A diminishing sperm count is not reversible! Dr Simon Fishel of the Worldwide Infertility Network - which has both European and US bases - suggests six ways to maintain sufficient amounts of healthy sperm:\n\nAvoid hot baths - the testicles need to be cooler than the rest of the body. \nWear loose underwear - boxers rather than Y-fronts. \nStop smoking and refrain from all recreational drugs. \nCut down on alcohol. \nIncrease your intake of zinc, which can be found in grains, beans, milk and meat. \nIncrease your intake of selenium. \nFor men with low sperm counts, but who are still fertile, there is no need to run to the nearest IVF clinic just yet. It is undoubtedly more pleasant to conceive a child in bed than in a clinic and clinics suggest that men try to increase their production of healthy sperm first, before undergoing expensive fertility treatments.\n\nTo increase your sperm count:\n\nYour diet should include the anti-oxidant vitamins C and E, which can be found in citrus fruits. Eating a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables is recommended anyway. \nMen are at their sexual peak in the morning, at this time more sperm is produced than in the evening. \nReduce your caffeine intake. No coffee, tea or stimulant drinks. \nIf none of these precautions appear to be helping, it may be necessary for you and your partner to visit an assisted reproduction clinic to ascertain fertility levels. Many techniques are available to induce pregnancy using sperm from men with extremely low sperm counts, so there is no need to despair.\n\n\"Although you might have a high sperm count, many of them might not be functioning properly\", explains Ms Butler. \"Motility for most samples is around 50%. Then we examine how well they swim. We also look at the morphology - the shape of the sperm\".", "doctor_answer": "Don't waste it until your ready to use it. Save it up for apx. two moths if possible. That is the time your body uses to make more of the little spermies. GL"}

{"question": "Why does it seem that most of the diets don't work on over weight people?", "patient_answer": "I think that the main reason is that obese people should be treated as drug addict. The main problem is that both obese and drug addicts have habits that causing them to either eat or do drug. Both of them also have physical addiction that needed to be treated accordingly. Only after facing those two major factors it will be the time for diets. <br />\nAnother major issue is that the society actually unknowingly supports obesity; let me give you an example- today in the US, an obese person can claim disability and get welfare. By that, the government actually encourages obesity. Why would someone even try to get better? <br />\nAuthorities should condition those allowances: if you lose weight over a specified period you will continue getting it. If you did not lose weight you lose the allowance.<br />\nWe should always keep in mind that obesity costs a lot more then just the allowance that the obese person gets. There is the health costs, taxes lost and so on.<br />\nI say- do what you can to leave healthy life, and don’t give up", "doctor_answer": "A key cause of obesity is the low nutritional content of industrially processed foods--because the body doesn't receive enough nutrition it continues to crave more food. Few diets focus, as they should, on non-processed nutritionally dense food--instead, in many cases, the patient is actually eating even more processed food products, exacerbating rather than solving the problem.<br />\n<br />\nBottom line, as we hear so often, obesity is largely caused by bad habits in terms of diet and exercise, and many people aren't willing to permanently let go of those habits, so it's hardly surprising when they fail to achieve the results they want."}

{"question": "What happens if you stop taking your HIV meds then start them again after two months off?", "patient_answer": "The problem with HIV meds is that eventually they are all rendered useless because the virus is able to mutate and become resistant. This is why patients get switched every year or so. Some medications are more prone tho this than others (for example the virus only require one mutation to develop resistance to one med, or 10 to develop resistance from another). When you go off your medication you run an increased risk of the virus having an opportunity to develop resistance to that medication.", "doctor_answer": "It would depend on what medications you were taking. If you hadn't started taking any medications it would be an easier question to answer. If you felt good while not taking medications it might be good to see if you could use the new approach which slows the immune response without hindering the immune system and without the side effects of prescription drugs being used to treat HIV. This new approach should be known by any HIV/AIDS medical professional. They may not understand if you say \" the approach that slows the immune response \" .

{"question": "what is AIDS?", "patient_answer": "AIDS or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, fatal disease caused by a rapidly mutating retrovirus that attacks the immune system and leaves the victim vulnerable to infections, malignancies, and neurological disorders. It was first recognized as a disease in 1981. The virus was isolated in 1983 and was ultimately named the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There are two forms of the HIV virus, HIV-1 and HIV-2. The majority of cases worldwide are caused by HIV-1. In 1999 an international team of genetic scientists reported that HIV-1 can be traced to a closely related strain of virus, called simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), that infects a subspecies of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in W central Africa. Chimpanzees are hunted for meat in this region, and it is believed the virus may have passed from the blood of chimpanzees into humans through superficial wounds, probably in the early 1930s.", "doctor_answer": "A severe immunological disorder caused by the retrovirus HIV, resulting in a defect in cell-mediated immune response that is manifested by increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and to certain rare cancers, especially Kaposi's sarcoma.

{"question": "nursing care for the sars?", "patient_answer": "As a nurse, you're on the front lines. Assessing patients, you could be the first health care professional to recognize that a patient has signs and symptoms of SARS. In SARS with moderate respiratory illness, you'll note a fever higher than 100.4° F (38° C) and one or more of the following symptoms: cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or hypoxia.\n\nIn SARS with severe symptoms of respiratory illness, you'll find a temperature greater than 100.4° F, one or more of the previously mentioned clinical signs and symptoms, and a chest X-ray that reveals pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The chest X-ray may be normal at first, but changes may appear 3 or 4 days following infection, particularly in the lung bases.\n\nIf your patient has some or all of these suspicious signs and symptoms, take a detailed medical and travel history to determine his risk of exposure to SARS. Suspect SARS if he reports either of the following circumstances within 10 days of symptom onset:\n\n* travel to an area with a known or suspected SARS outbreak. Just passing through the airport counts. The CDC Web site (httpV/www.cdc.gov/ ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm) can tell you which areas qualify\n\n* close contact with someone known or suspected to have SARS.\n\nIf you work in a primary care provider's office and suspect that a patient has SARS, contact the hospital before sending the patient there, so that hospital staff can make arrangements to prevent transmission of SARS to others in the facility.\n\nIf you suspect SARS...\n\nImmediately have your patient put on a surgical face mask and make arrangements to isolate him, ideally in a negative-pressure isolation room. Protect yourself by donning an N95 disposable paniculate respirator or surgical mask, gown, gloves, and eye protection and observing meticulous hand hygiene.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that any health care provider caring for a patient with a suspected case of SARS notify local public health authorities as soon as possible, so the patient's close contacts can be tracked and monitored. (Health Canada recommends similar management strategies.)\n\nDiagnostic tests for SARS\n\nThe SARS virus may be detected in a patient's nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal secretions, blood serum, or stool. The CDC, as well as many state public health labs, can process specimens. Three types of diagnostic tests are used for SARS:\n\n* a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test to detect RNA of SARS-CoV Two tests on two different specimens must be positive to confirm SARS.\n\n* serum tests to detect antibodies IgM (gamma M immunoglobulin) and IgG (gamma G immunoglobulin). The test result is negative if no SARS-CoV antibodies are found in serum obtained more than 28 days after symptom onset.\n\n* a viral cell culture test to detect SARS-CoV\n\nIn September 2003, a 15-minute, palm-sized SARS detection kit was developed by Genelabs Diagnostics and the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, both of Singapore. This test generates accurate results with just a drop of serum, plasma, or blood and is designed to be used by people without special training in locations (such as airports) where lab facilities aren't available. The test is expected to be available to hospitals soon.\n\nOther helpful tests\n\nAlong with baseline vital signs, chest X-rays, and the diagnostic tests listed above, tests that may help confirm or rule out SARS include a complete blood cell count, arterial blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry values, clotting profile, respiratory viral panel for influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial viruses, metabolic profile, examination of bronchoalveolar lavage from the lower respiratory tract, C-reactive protein test, and Legionella and pneumococcal urinary antigen testing.\n\nPatients with SARS may have lymphopenia and mild thrombocytopenia.

However, the studies with the best placebo controls have not been able to demonstrate that light treatment has a benefit beyond its placebo effect. \n\nPeople in northern hemisphere are more prone for depression as they r not exposed to sunlight often. so for their depression drs recommend sunlight or artificial lights to stimuate their endocine system and maintain the circadian rhythm of the body", "doctor_answer": "Light does affect people. Seasonal affective disorder is a type of depression that seems to be brought on by the lower levels of sunlight in the winter in the cold climates. It is true that many people just feel more sluggish in cloudy/rainy/snowy weather, but Seasonal Affective Disorder causes a much more serious disturbance of mood.\n\nNow, light therapy is a recognized and effective technique for treating seasonal affective disorder. But, it has to be very bright light. Leaving the light on at night won't cut it. In order to work, the bright light has to shine into the eyes.

{"question": "What's worse?  Physical or Mental Pain?", "patient_answer": "I think that mental pain is worse simply because if there is enough mental pain it can be the reason to inflict physical pain either on oneself or another person.\nIf you're talking about abuse, that's a different story.  Both mental and physical abuse should be taken care of in the same aspect, it doesn't matter if an abuser doesn't \"touch\" the other person, it's a matter of the permanent damage caused.  When someone who is depressed or has been mentally abused says they are \"in pain\" they mean it.  It's a proven fact that when someone who is mentally \"in pain\" says they are in pain, the brain is responding in the same way it would if there were physical pain being inflicted on the person.  So, mental pain causes physical pain and vice versa.\nSorry if this answer is kind of out of order and long winded, but I wanted to try to explain myself.", "doctor_answer": "The whip.  The whip.

{"question": "What is the best way to fight a cold?", "patient_answer": "How to Fight a Cold Naturally \n\nThe common cold is caused by a virus rather than bacteria, so antibiotics can't help. Work on building up your immune system and relieving your symptoms.\n \n \nSteps:\n1.  Take time off. Getting adequate rest will help you get over your cold quickly.\n \n2.  Drink more water than you usually do. Eight glasses a day is standard when you're healthy, so try to drink more than that.\n \n3.  Substitute herbal tea or juice for water to make your liquid intake goals.\n \n4.  Let your appetite dictate how much you eat. If you're not hungry at all, try eating something that's easy to digest, like a banana. Sugar may have a negative impact on your immune system, so limit sweets.\n \n5. Eat chicken soup if it makes you feel better. It can't rid your body of the virus, but it's easy to digest and may soothe your throat.\n \n6. Drink an immune-boosting tea of echinacea or goldenseal. You can also take capsules or a tincture.\n \n7. Load up on Vitamin C every few hours, and take zinc according to bottle directions.\n \n \nTips:\nUse slippery elm and marshmallow for an irritated throat and cough.\n \nAs with any type of medication, take herbs and supplements according to bottle instructions.\n \nWarnings:\nIf you have any questions or concerns, contact a physician or other healthcare professional before engaging in any activity related to health and diet.

So, I guess my recommendation regarding root canals would be that if you are a healthy person, with a good immune system, a root canal would probably be a good option, rather than losing your tooth.  But, I do believe they could impact your health, and the decision should be an informed one.", "doctor_answer": "Any medical procedure can. I've had 3 and had no problems."}

The cornea is cut, or \"flapped\", to give the surgeon's lasers access to the lens.\n\nAfter healing, the flap leaves a slight scar tissue that,  when subjected to pressure changes, can lead to blurry vision. These pressure changes are usually caused by high-altitude hiking, scuba diving or some other extreme method. Even a pressurized airplane cabin can cause the blurriness.\n\nThere are alternatives in which the cornea is not cut, but the correction acuity is not as exact as that of lasik. In this method, the lens is heated up reshaped with no incisions at all.

{"question": "do you know what bi polar is i have two brothers that have it one is 17 and the other is 15 can you help me?", "patient_answer": "Bipolar disorder--which is also known as manic-depressive illness and will be called by both names throughout this publication--is a mental illness involving episodes of serious mania and depression. The person's mood usually swings from overly \"high\" and irritable to sad and hopeless, and then back again, with periods of normal mood in between. \n\nBipolar disorder typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood and continues throughout life. It is often not recognized as an illness, and people who have it may suffer needlessly for years or even decades. \n\nEffective treatments are available that greatly alleviate the suffering caused by bipolar disorder and can usually prevent its devastating complications. These include marital break-ups, job loss, alcohol and drug abuse, and suicide. \n\nHere are some facts about bipolar disorder. \n\n  \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAWARENESS\nManic-depressive illness has a devastating impact on many people.\nAt least 2 million Americans suffer from manic-depressive illness. For those afflicted with the illness, it is extremely distressing and disruptive.\n\nLike other serious illnesses, bipolar disorder is also hard on spouses, family members, friends, and employers.\n\nFamily members of people with bipolar disorder often have to cope with serious behavioral problems (such as wild spending sprees) and the lasting consequences of these behaviors.\n\nBipolar disorder tends to run in families and is believed to be inherited in many cases. Despite vigorous research efforts, a specific genetic defect associated with the disease has not yet been detected.\n\nBipolar illness has been diagnosed in children under age 12, although it is not common in this age bracket. It can be confused with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, so careful diagnosis is necessary. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRECOGNITION\nBipolar disorder involves cycles of mania and depression.\nSigns and symptoms of mania include discrete periods of: \n\nIncreased energy, activity, restlessness, racing thoughts, and rapid talking\n\nExcessive \"high\" or euphoric feelings\n\nExtreme irritability and distractibility\n\nDecreased need for sleep\n\nUnrealistic beliefs in one's abilities and powers\n\nUncharacteristically poor judgment\n\nA sustained period of behavior that is different from usual\n\nIncreased sexual drive\n\nAbuse of drugs, particularly cocaine, alcohol, and sleeping medications\n\nProvocative, intrusive, or aggressive behavior\n\nDenial that anything is wrong \nSigns and symptoms of depression include discrete periods of: \n\nPersistent sad, anxious, or empty mood\n\nFeelings of hopelessness or pessimism\n\nFeelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness\n\nLoss of interest or pleasure in ordinary activities, including sex\n\nDecreased energy, a feeling of fatigue or of being \"slowed down\"\n\nDifficulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions\n\nRestlessness or irritability\n\nSleep disturbances\n\nLoss of appetite and weight, or weight gain\n\nChronic pain or other persistent bodily symptoms that are not caused by physical disease\n\nThoughts of death or suicide; suicide attempts \nIt may be helpful to think of the various mood states in manic-depressive illness as a spectrum or continuous range. At one end is severe depression, which shades into moderate depression; then come mild and brief mood disturbances that many people call \"the blues,\" then normal mood, then hypomania (a mild form of mania), and then mania. \n\nSome people with untreated bipolar disorder have repeated depressions and only an occasional episode of hypomania (bipolar II). In the other extreme, mania may be the main problem and depression may occur only infrequently. In fact, symptoms of mania and depression may be mixed together in a single \"mixed\" bipolar", "doctor_answer": "Manic Depression. See a doctor."}

Cancer cells, like hair cells grow and divide their DNA at a fast rate. The radiation disrupts the molecular structure if the helix resulting in an inability to replicate. Thus, the cancer is \"killed\". Hair loss is common."}

That's why it is important to support your immune system. Seasonal Defense combines andrographis with other immune-supporting herbs, including Fructus aurantia (six percent synephrine extract), thyme, oregano and eleuthero root for complete immune support.\n\nAndrographis has been used for centuries by many cultures. It is used widely in Ayurvedic medicine and is considered a “cold property” herb in traditional Chinese approaches; it is used to rid the body of “heat” and dispel toxins. Andrographis supports the immune system by promoting both specific and non-specific immune-response functions as well as maintaining the muscles in the respiratory system. Other studies show that synephrine may be able to help maintain the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract and that thyme and eleuthero root both have beneficial properties.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBenefits: \n•  Helps the body defend against seasonal changes. \n•  Contains andrographis to help boost the immune system. \n•  Helps support mucous membrane health. \n \nPurchase Information \nSEASONAL DEFENSE (90)  \nStock No.:806-6 \nQV: 12.40 \nMember Cost: $12.40\nNon-Member Cost: $18.60  \n\nhttp://www.mynsp.com/lifemoreabundantlyinc/products/guide.aspx?stockNum=8066"}

It takes a lot more energy to move a body that's 50lbs overweight than one that's at optimal weight.  So you have to take in more calories to feel satiated.\n\nOf course there ARE people who are addicted to food and the pleasure they feel when they're eating it (possibly as a way to cope with the depression caused by being overweight).

{"question": "how do i give a neck massage?", "patient_answer": "If you are just starting out, put your hands solidly on the shoulders, and only use your thumbs to massage around the neck, until you figure out how much pressure is best to use on each person, and to make sure you can support yourself during the massage.  Some people tend to sway back and forth during massages, and that can add more pressure on the neck if you aren't grounded first.  Back massages, I find it best to massage in circles, pusing the muscles AWAY from the spine.  Muscles tend to tighten and pull towards the spine, and you want to take that pressure off.  Always listen to the person you are massaging, if you are hurting them, then they will tighten up to try and handle the pain, you don't want this, you want them relaxed.  Always give a massage in a warm room, and if you find it hard working around their skin, find a massage oil, or pliable hand lotion that is easy to work with.

Specifically, proteins that are bound to the DNA of every cell are detected as foreign invaders by the immune system.  That's why anti-dsDNA antibodies are offten diagnostic of lupus.  Lupus is more common in women than men, causes a \"wolf\" like rash on the face, and causes enlarging of organs, particularly the spleen, it causes generalized pain and fatigue and can incapacitate people for extended periods of time during flare-ups.  Prednisone and other steroids can relieve the symptoms, sometimes causing remission to occur.  Others can die of acute lupus, if chronic inflammation ensues. As with all other autoimmune diseases scientists are unclear as to what triggers lupus but iit is thought to be some combination of genetic factors and enviironmental exposure, some high blood pressure medications can cause lupus after extended use."}
{"question": "treatment of tonsilities?", "patient_answer": "Tonsillitis is most often caused by a virus, which resolves on its own. However, tonsillitis can be caused by strep throat bacteria, which requires treatment with antibiotics.

You should not be afraid to ask your eye doctor this type of question.  To answer your question though, it could just mean that the muscles around your eye that make it move may be weak and just need strengthening.  They have programs (even some on the computer) that can help in the strengthening of these muscles.  But you really need to discuss this with your eye doctor.", "doctor_answer": "Ocular myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disease of the neuromuscular junction resulting in hallmark variability in muscle weakness and fatigability. MG is an autoimmune disease where anomalous antibodies are produced against the naturally occurring acetylcholine (ACh) receptors in voluntary muscles. MG may be limited to the muscles of the eye (ocular MG), leading to abrupt onset of weakness/fatigability of the eyelids or eye movement. MG may also involve other muscle groups (generalized MG). This article will focus on ocular MG, as the generalized form is discussed elsewhere (Myasthenia gravis).\n\n\nAlthough these blocking antibodies may be confined to one of the larger muscles responsible for moving the face or appendages or for breathing, about 90% of MG patients eventually have eye involvement. The most common symptoms are double vision (diplopia) and eyelid drooping (ptosis), whereas the pupil is always spared. Diplopia occurs when MG affects a single extraocular muscle in one eye, limiting eye movement and leading to double vision when the eye is turned toward the affected muscle. Ptosis occurs when the muscle responsible for eyelid elevation is affected on one or both sides, leading to eyelid drooping. Although these symptoms may not be readily apparent in well-rested patients, weakness can usually be induced with exercise of the commonly affected muscles (ie. by having the patient look upward for about 60 seconds).\n\nIn 75% of MG cases, the initial manifestation is in the eye. Within 2 years, 80% of patients with ocular onset of MG will progress to involve other muscle groups, thereby developing generalized MG. The other 20% of patients continue to have purely ocular MG. If MG is confined to the ocular muscles for more than 3 years, there is a 94% likelihood that the symptoms will not worsen or generalize.\n\nAside from asymmetric ptosis (worse with fatigue, sustained upgaze and at the end of the day) and variable limitation of extraocular muscles/diplopia, other clinical signs of ocular MG include gaze-evoked nystagmus (rapid, involuntary, oscillatory motion of the eyeball) and Cogan’s lid twitch (upper lid twitch present when patient looks straight ahead after looking down for 10-15 seconds).\n\nMG is characteristically variable in course, with the frequency of diplopia and ptosis affected by environmental, emotional and physical factors such as bright sunlight, stress, viral illness, menstruation, pregnancy, etc. Spontaneous remission can occur in any patient and remain for years. In a study of the natural history of generalized MG among 168 patients (with an average follow-up of 12 years), 14% experienced complete remission."}

Do you have regular periods?  If you aren't having regular periods, that means you aren't ovulating, that your ovaries aren't working and putting out eggs.  In that case, a fertility drug like Clomid can sure help you to ovulate.  Have you had gonorrhea or chlamydia infection in your past?  That can scar up your fallopian tubes, so that even if you ovulate, the eggs can't get down to uterus.  Surgery can sometimes help, or just keep trying.  Take your oral temperature every morning.  It will rise a little bit when you ovulate, which is prime time to try getting pregnant.  Ovulation is generally about 14 days before the start of your period.  If your periods are like clockwork, then count back 14 days from the scheduled start of your next period.  That is time to \"do it\".  It helps for the woman to have an orgasm to get pregnant.

{"question": "I ve a very severe short sightedness which affects just an eye and doctors say glasses won't help. pls advice", "patient_answer": "Well, I don't know the specifics of your problem, but I can offer a bit of an explanation of what your doctor said.  Glasses wouldn't help you because the lenses for each eye would be dramatically different.  Since you're very near-sighted in the one eye, you would need a very strong lens that would ultimately make the image on your retina much smaller than the image on your other retina.  If these two images are very different sizes, your brain can't put them together into one image and you see double.  If both of your eyes can be corrected to 20/20 vision, I would ask your doctor (or another doctor, if you'd like a second opinion) if LASIK is an option for you.  This could possibly bring your very near-sighted eye close enough to the other eye so that your brain would be able to make a single image.", "doctor_answer": "I've been using spec's with different glasses fo decades. I think you should try another eye specialist. It's a common problem. So either you must have misunderstood the doctor, or he/she is a quack"}
{"question": "What is the meaning of EMR as in a physician's office?", "patient_answer": "The difference between Personal Health Records (PHRs) and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is scope.  Personal Heatlh Record is the basic unit of an EHR - that is, it only describes information about one person.  A PHR is one instance of a EHR.  EHR could be used to describe a collection of many PHRs in a system at a particular hospital, for example.  One EHR though describes the entire health of a patient, which can include old information (past surgeries, for example), current information (what medications are being prescribed), or future information (what is the future medical treatment plan for this patient).\n\nElectronic Medical Records (EMRs) are similar to EHRs but are more specific to medical information.  Health information is broader and may include information on the patient's diet, their consent in a clinical trial, and other non-medically related details of their health.\n\nThe official standards for these terms and definitions can be found below.  These are put out by the HIMSS (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society) and approved by the Health Level 7 committee - a major player in electronic medical record standards.", "doctor_answer": "This is a complex issue because there are different ways of looking at the attributes of \"records\" and many different stakeholders in healthcare that view the \"person\" from different perspectives. Terminology is key, and there is still no ccnsensus on terms. Patient-centric health records could be EMR, EHR, PHR, CPR or many other things. There is a \"view\" that keys off the name of the person themselves, which is the most common way for interacting with any type of electronic records in healthcare. However, the creation of data, communication around it, organization, and rules may well be \"clinician or organization-centric\".  A \"Person-centered\" record would revolve primarily around that person regardless of whether they went to hospitals, pharmacies, alternative care providers, clinics, or did self care. The rules around access, what types of information are included, how information is validated, audits of activity, and how communication occurs would emanate from the preferences of the \"person\" not the constraints of a specific organization, practice, or integrated network.\n\nOne way to summarize is that an EMR is a set of records and processes for whom the primary stakeholder is the clinician practice (even if in the context of a hospital). An Inbox, a document repository, an ordering system, and disease registry/alerts have certain features that are more important when in the context of an EMR. Documenting care is critical to being reimbursed, if you are a clinician. It is more critical for safety and clarity if you are a patient, because of the focus on what others might need to do with the information. Of course in the real world this is a far more \"grey zone\" and there is more overlap than not.  \n\nA PHR could be viewed as a set of records and processes for whom the primary stakeholder is the patient and family caregiver.  There might be times when it is more helpful for a clinician to be looking at, updating or interacting with a PHR than with their own EMR! (it is one thing to send a message out from an EMR and hope it gets to the patient, it is another thing to post a message about a patient directly into their \"personal space\" where there might be a clearer understanding about how that patient is intending to receive and interact with information). \n\nAs the world of online personal information management and identity management mature, this focus on the primary \"stakeholder\" might become a more important one. The American Health Information Management Association has done some very good work around the PHR. They represent a very large number of medical records professionals, and have a broad industry perspective on the PHR.  Medicare, as well as other large payers, are actively exploring their roles relative to the patient-centric PHR as well. Active ongoing public diaogues and blogs in which both clinicians, consumers, care managers, and other stakeholders participate, might be a very good way to gradually develop a more universal set of definitions around the PHR itself."}

{"question": "I have been diagnosed with degenerative disease, could you tell me about the disease please? Thank you?", "patient_answer": "Degenerative disease is, in fact not a real disease. It is a process of wear and tear that occurs with ageing in virtually all individuals. It is also referred to as osteoarthritis, arthrosis and spinal arthritis. The joint surface may become eroded and the gristle or cartilage that lines the joint is no longer smooth but pitted. This results in pain and inflammation occurring with movement. In addition to this there is a process of thickening in the ligaments around the joints as well, a gradual deformity of the joint itself rather like the end of a stick that has been hit with a mallet. The result is a splaying out of the joint surface and this edge of bone (osteophytes) causes a characteristic appearance with apparent swelling and enlargement of the joint itself. In addition to these changes, the joint may become inflamed with redness heat and swelling with accompanying pain. Typically the inflammation comes on overnight once the joint is rested and gradually wears off as the joint gets moving.", "doctor_answer": "Degenerative disc disease is one of the most common causes of low back pain, and also one of the most misunderstood.  Many patients diagnosed with low back pain caused by degenerative disc disease are left wondering exactly what this diagnosis means for them. Common questions that are often on patients’ minds include:\n\nIf I have low back pain from degenerative disc disease in my thirties, how much worse will it become with age? \n\nWill the degenerative disc disease become a crippling condition? Will I end up in a wheelchair?\n\nShould I restrict my activities? \n\nCan I still play sports? \n\nWill the degenerative disc disease spread to other parts of the spine? \n\nWill the low back pain from degenerative disc disease cause any permanent damage?"}

{"question": "What is diverticolitis?", "patient_answer": "Some people have little pouches hanging off their colons; this outpounching is called a diverticulum.  A diverticulum resembles the appendix in many ways.  Since a diverticulum is a pouch with a single openening, and there is not a constant flow through it, some fecal matter may get caught in it.  This can lead to infection and inflammation.  This inflammation is call diverticulutis.\n\nA particular concern about diverticulitis is that the diverticulum has a narrow wall, which can perforate easily, leaking contents into the rest of the abdomen.  The diverticulum can also develop a connection to another organ and cause all sorts of problems.\n\nThis will only occur with sever inflammation, and when the inflammation is this bad, the only treatment is surgery.", "doctor_answer": "Diverticulitis is a common disease of the bowel, in particular the large intestine.

{"question": "what is best cure for eczema?", "patient_answer": "Eczema Treatment Guide\n\nAtopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a common problem in infants and children. It usually begins between two and six months of age with very dry and sensitive skin that will then become red and extremely itchy. It often starts on the forehead, cheeks and scalp and spreads to the trunk, creases of the elbows, knees, and wrists. With scratching the rash may become raw, crusted and weepy.\n\nIt is not yet known what causes it, but it does seem to run in families that have a history of asthma, allergies or atopic dermatitis. It is a chronic disease, but only about a third of children with infantile atopic dermatitis will continue to have problems with it as they get older.\n\nThere is no cure for this common condition. The main treatments are aimed at controlling and preventing inflammation and itching and include avoiding triggers, frequent bathing and hydrating of the skin, liberal use of moisturizers and lubricants, and the use of steroid creams for flare ups.\n\nNew Medications Protopic: or tacrolimus, an immunomodulator ointment that in the 0.03% strength is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) when other therapies have not been effective. Elidel: or pimercrolimus, is another non-steroidal cream that in the 1% strength is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (eczema) in children over 2 years of age.\n\nLubricants\nTo help with dryness, these creams, such as Eucerin, Nivea, or Lubriderm, should be used every day, even when the eczema isn't flaring-up!\n\nApply right after baths within 3 minutes (and after the steroid creams) to help trap in moisture and throughout the day as needed. For severely dry skin, try using an ointment, such as Aquaphor.\n\nAlternative lubricants that some parents find useful include Hydrolatum and Vanicream.\n\nMany experts recommend avoiding moisturizing lotions, as they often don't work as well as a cream or ointment.\n\nSteroid Creams\nThese are the main treatments for atopic dermatitis when it flares up, and should be applied right after baths (and before a lubricant) and again during the day as directed. When the rash improves, cut back on how often you are using it and then stop until the rash flares up again.\n\nCommon steroid creams include Cutivate, Westcort and Artistocort, and Elocon.\n\nAvoid using prescription steroid creams on the face or in the diaper area, unless specifically instructed to do so. An over the counter 1% Hydrocortisone cream is safer in these areas.\n\nFor severe cases of eczema, a steroid ointment may be more effective than a cream.\n\nIf your child's eczema improves when he is on a steroid and then quickly flares up again when you stop, it may help to use a 'step down' strategy where you taper the use of the steroid and use it less often, for example every other day and then 2-3 times a week, before finally stopping it. Or use a less potent steroid, like over the counter hydrocortizone after using a prescription strength steroid like Cutivate or Elocon.\n\nYou might also ask your doctor about one of the newer non-steroidal medications, like Protopic or Elidel.\n\nBathing and Eczema\nBathing and eczema is a controversial topic, but many people think the practice of limiting baths is old school or old fashioned. Many experts now recommend a daily bath for kids with eczema.\n\nA daily bath for at least 15-20 minutes helps to moisturize the skin and make it less itchy. Be sure to use a mild, nondrying soap, such as Dove, Neutrogena, Tone, Caress, Dial, Basis, or Purpose, avoid vigorous scrubbing, use a soft towel to pat the skin dry and immediately (within 3 minutes) apply a lubricating cream afterwards.\n\nIf your child's skin is not tolerating a daily bath, limit baths to every other day or try using a soap substitute, such as Cetaphil.

{"question": "What exactly is Lupus & how many  people die annually?", "patient_answer": "Lupus erythematosus (also known as systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE) is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies are created against the patient's own DNA. It can cause various symptoms, but the main ones relate to the skin, kidney (lupus nephritis), joints, blood and immune system.\n\nCommon initial and chronic complaints are fever, malaise, joint pains, myalgias and fatigue. Because they are so often seen with other diseases, these signs and symptoms are not part of the diagnostic criteria for SLE. When occurring in conjunction with other signs and symptoms, however, they are considered suggestive.\n\nSLE is a chronic disease with no cure. There are, however, some medications, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants which can control the disease and prevent flares. Flares are typically treated with steroids, with DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheutmatic drugs) to suppress the disease process, reduce steroid needs and prevent flares. DMARDs commonly in use are the antimalarials (e.g. hydroxychloroquine) and azathioprine. Cyclophosphamide is used for severe nephritis or other organ-damaging complications.\n\nPatients who require steroids frequently may develop obesity, diabetes and osteoporosis. Hence, steroids are avoided where possible.\n\nMeasures such as avoiding sunlight (to prevent problems due to photosensitivity) may also have some effect.\n\nOther immunosuppressants and autologous stem cell transplants are under investigation.\n\nA good website is the \"Alliance for Lupus Research\" at http://www.lupusresearch.org/", "doctor_answer": "Lupus: The lupus widespread eritematoso, or simply lupus, is an illness of the system of immunity that is sometimes lethal, and it affects to a considerable quantity of American, between 500.000 and 1.000.000.

I dont think so.  They have alternative medicines that can even cure 3rd stage cancer with a 80%-90% cure rate.  Even when doctors have given up.

So, you can look up CESIUM CHLORIDE, OXYGEN DROPS, GREEN ALGAE, OR PAW PAW on the internet.  There are also doctors that are scattered across the USA who specialize in homeopathic cures for cancer.  They can be costly because they are not in every state.  The closest one to me is like 7 states away.  You never hear about these doctors because they are not allowed to make a big stir about it or else they will hear about it from the medical community who just want to take your money.  If they keep quiet, they will not be bothered by the medical community.  You have early stage, so you can take these medicines without a problem.

{"question": "What's the difference between Allegra and Benadryl?", "patient_answer": "They are actually both antihistimines (although Benadryl does come in a topical formula).\n\nAllegra requires a prescription, Benadryl does not.  Allegra has a formulation that lasts 24 hours (the 180mg version); their other formulation (the 60mg version) lasts 12 hours.  I believe Benadryl allergy is a 50mg version (so you need to take a more doses per day for the same length relief).\n\nThe active ingredient in each is different as well:  Allegra 180mg (the 24 hour extended version) has two active ingredients (fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride); regular Allegra's active ingredient is fexofenadine hydrochloride, and Benadryl's active ingredient is Diphenhydramine.\n\nIf both work equally well for you, it's probably more economical for you to go with the prescription (if you have health insurance) - the co-pay will be less for a 30 day supply than it would cost for 30 days worth of Over The Counter Benadryl.", "doctor_answer": "Allegra is an antihistamine; I believe it's taken internally, and it will address some of the symptoms of an airborne allergy--runny nose, itchy eyes, achy muscles, etc.\n\nBenadryl is a topical anti-itch (and mildly anesthetic?) goo to reduce the itchiness of a bug bite or rash or whatever.  Not the same category as Allegra; it's more like calamine lotion (white stuff often used for poison ivy/oak)."}

{"question": "What is cataracts?", "patient_answer": "is any opacity which develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its envelope. Cataracts form for a variety of reasons, including long term ultraviolet exposure, secondary effects of diseases such as diabetes, or simply due to advanced age; they are usually a result of denaturation of lens proteins. Genetic factors are often a cause of congenital cataracts and may also play a role in predisposing someone to cataracts. Some cataract formation is to be expected in any person over the age of 70. Fully half of all people between the ages of 65 and 74 and about 70% of those over 75 have some cataract formation. Cataracts may also be produced by eye injury or physical trauma. A study among Icelandair pilots showed commercial airline pilots as three times as likely to develop cataracts as people with non-flying jobs.

{"question": "What can I do to quit smoking?", "patient_answer": "I have smoked for 10 years and acidently started reducing my intake of cig's.  How you ask. . . I saw a sign that said, \"Free Message\", and I went in.  There I got to try a message bed that has acupuncture and infa-red heating (plus more).  After several tryies on this bed, I noticed that I would not smoke for 3 hours after I got a message.  I turned to one of my \"Quit Smoking\" guides, and it reccommended messages as a tool to help reduce cravings.\n\nI took it another step and tryied \"Hypnosis\".  I bet you've seen the adds. . . \"Quit Smoking\" through Hypnosis.  So I went, participated in the hypnosis program, & bought the hypnosis tapes. \n\nWith hypnosis, I did not have migrain headaches like when I used the patch or Zyban, I did not pass-out cold for two days like when I tryed Cold Turkey, and I have not been an angy-tense-emotional person like all of past times I've tryed.\n\nIt's been 10 days since I've had a cig. . . I go daily for my free message and while I get my message, I listen to my \"Stop Smoking Hypnosis\" Tape plus a extra Hypnosis tape (Deppression, Anger Management, Weight Loss, Memory Improvement, Relationship enhancement for Women, ect).  You probably don't realize that taking away the chemicals in cigaretts can make your memory decrease, or you get depressed. . . but this is part of the big factor of giving up the cig's. . . This is part of the reason why you can't give them up is because there are too many other emotions that stop you. . . So this is why I listen to the other tapes as well. \n\nMy hypnotic instructor told me to listen to the tapes 2-3 times a day for 21 days (each tape is 20 minutes long).  So I spend 40 minutes to 1.5 hours a day practicing to quit smoking.  Now, when I smoked, I had 15 cigs a day.  Each cig took 10 minutes to smoke.  So I spent 2.5 hours a day smoking.  So I've actually gained time.\n\n5 days after I quit, I found a pack of cig's with 1 cig (my upside down lucky cig), and I was tempted for 1/100 of a second, and then smashed it and said\" I am a non-smoker\".  \n\nSo basically, my daily message's and hypnosis tapes are working better than any past attempt I've ever tried! I wish you luck, and please wish me luck to stay a non-smoker. Thanks", "doctor_answer": "Use the patch for starters it works! If you have acid reflux trust me do not try the gum.

{"question": "What causes appendicitis?", "patient_answer": "What is appendicitis?\nAppendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. It is thought that appendicitisbegins when the opening from the appendix into the cecum becomes blocked. Theblockage may be due to a build-up of thick mucus within the appendix or to stool that enters the appendix from the cecum. The mucus or stool hardens, becomes rock-like, and blocks the opening. This rock is called a fecalith (literally, arock of stool). At other times, the lymphatic tissue in the appendix may swell and block the appendix. Bacteria which normally are found within the appendixthen begin to invade (infect) the wall of the appendix. The body responds to theinvasion by mounting an attack on the bacteria, an attack called inflammation.(An alternative theory for the cause of appendicitis is an initial rupture ofthe appendix followed by spread of bacteria outside the appendix.. The cause ofsuch a rupture is unclear, but it may relate to changes that occur in thelymphatic tissue that line the wall of the appendix.)", "doctor_answer": "An infection and inflamation of the appendix.\n\nThe appendix is a little appendage hanging off your intestines.

{"question": "Why would a newborn child get johndus?Why yellow skin?Whats the cure?", "patient_answer": "Many children are born with JAUNDICE.  When the baby was in the womb, the mother's liver took care of the excess pigment (called bilirubin) in the blood that causes jaundice. It takes a while for the baby's liver to be able to process and eliminate it. \n\nMild cases can be treated by exposing baby briefly to sunlight and making sure baby is getting plenty of fluids (breastmilk is best).  More severe cases can be treated by your pediatrician using special light therapy.", "doctor_answer": "What is jaundice? \nJaundice is an illness that can happen in the first few days of a baby's life. It turns your baby's skin, eyes and mouth a yellow color. The yellow color is caused by bilirubin.\n\nBilirubin is made when the body breaks down old red blood cells. This is a normal process that happens all through life. Bilirubin goes to the liver, where it is changed again. Then it goes into the intestines and the kidneys, and then it goes out of the body. If too much bilirubin builds up in your baby's body, it makes a yellow color called jaundice (say: \"john-diss\").\n\nJaundice is common in babies and is usually not serious.\n\nWhy do some babies get jaundice? \nRed blood cells have a shorter life in babies than they do in adults. This means more bilirubin goes through your baby's liver. If your baby's skin is bruised during birth, more red cells may need to be broken down. Then your baby's liver has to handle even more bilirubin. Sometimes a baby's liver is not mature enough to handle the extra bilirubin.\n\n\nHow can I tell if my baby has jaundice? \nYou should watch for color changes in your baby's skin. You should also check the whites of your baby's eyes and the pink skin inside your baby's mouth. If they get yellowish, you may want to see your baby's doctor. If your baby has pale skin, it should look white when you gently press it with your fingertips. If the skin looks yellow, your baby may have jaundice. If your baby has darker skin, it may be harder to check, except by looking at your baby's eyes and inside your baby's mouth.\n\nArtificial light, especially fluorescent lights, can sometimes fool your eyes into seeing a yellow color that is not really there. So you might want to check your baby in daylight in a sunny room.\n\nAs the amount of bilirubin in the blood increases, your baby's body will get more yellow. As the bilirubin level rises, the yellow color can move from your baby's head down to the chest and even down to the toes.\n\nIf your baby's skin is yellow, see your baby's doctor right away. The doctor will take a small amount of your baby's blood and measure the bilirubin in it.\n\n\nHow is jaundice treated? \nIf the bilirubin level is not too high, your baby might not need any treatment. Your doctor might just want you to feed your baby breast milk or formula more often.\n\nIf the bilirubin level is very high or is getting higher very quickly, your baby will need light therapy. This is also called phototherapy. Phototherapy helps to break down bilirubin in your baby's skin.\n\nFor this treatment, your baby is placed under special white, blue or green lights. The baby might also be placed on a special light-producing blanket. Your baby's eyes are covered to protect them from the bright lights. Phototherapy usually lasts for 1 or 2 days.\n\nPhototherapy can give your baby loose stools, temperature problems or dehydration. Your doctor will watch your baby carefully to prevent or treat these problems.\n\nIf your baby's bilirubin level gets too high, and phototherapy does not work well enough, the baby might need an exchange transfusion. In this treatment, some of your baby's blood is taken out, and it is replaced with blood from someone else.\n\n\nCan jaundice hurt my baby? \nJaundice is not a serious problem in most healthy babies. However, very high bilirubin levels can be dangerous. It can give some babies brain damage.\n\nYour doctor will measure your baby's bilirubin level a number of times. If necessary, your baby will be treated. This usually keeps the bilirubin level from getting high enough to hurt your baby.\n\n \n\nHow long will my baby have jaundice? \nJaundice lasts for a different time in different babies. Often, the bilirubin level goes up for the first 3 to 4 days and then slowly goes back down. A baby who is breastfed may have mild jaundice for a longer time than a baby who is formula-fed."}

You can buy a basal thermometer and track your temperature every day at the same time.  When you see a spike it means that you are ovulating.  You can also purchase ovulation predictor tests and fertility microscopes which will tell you when you are fertile.  Another thing you can do is track your vaginal mucus.  On days when it is clear and stringy, it means you are ovulating.  You can also use software to record your basal temp and mucus findings, and it will calculate when would be the optimum fertility time, along with other information.

{"question": "How can I best help someone who is bi-polar?", "patient_answer": "Understand it as well as possible and then be supportive of treatments. This FAQ's might help you.\n\n1. What is bipolar disorder? \n\nBipolar disorder is a common, recurrent, severe psychiatric illness that affects an individual's mood, behavior and ability to think clearly. It occurs in 1% to 2% of the population in the United States. A variant, called bipolar II disorder, is probably even more common and occurs in up to 3% of the general population in this country. \n\n2. What are the differences between bipolar I and bipolar II disorders? \n\nBipolar I disorder is characterized by episodes of mania that alternate with periods of depression or periods in which individuals have simultaneously occurring manic and depressive symptoms called mixed states. In contrast, bipolar II disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and milder symptoms of mania, called hypomania. Hypomanic episodes typically do not impair an individual's ability to function to the extent that full-blown manic episodes do additionally; hypomanic episodes are not complicated by psychotic symptoms. \n\n3. What is rapid cycling? \n\nThe term rapid cycling was originally coined by David Dunner, M.D., and Ron Fieve, M.D., in the 1970s when they identified a group of individuals who did not respond well to lithium. These patients typically had four or more episodes of mania or depression in the 12-month interval prior to lithium treatment. This definition has been adopted formally by DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.) and specifically means the occurrence of four or more mood episodes within the preceding year. In severe cases, rapid cycling can occur even within a one-day period. \n\n4. At what age does bipolar disorder appear? \n\nBipolar disorder most commonly presents in the late teens and early 20s. Unfortunately, for most individuals, lifelong treatment may be required to prevent recurrent manic and depressive episodes. Equally unfortunate is evidence that the illness often goes undiagnosed and untreated for many years; the longer the illness progresses without treatment, the greater the impairment in an individual's psychological, educational and vocational development. Additionally, untreated bipolar disorder carries a high risk of suicide. \n\n5. Is bipolar disorder genetic? \n\nBipolar disorder, among all psychiatric illnesses, may have the greatest genetic contribution. For instance, if an individual has a parent with bipolar disorder, the chance that the individual's child will have bipolar disorder is about nine-fold greater than in the general population, with the risk rising from about 1% to about 10%. The inheritability of this illness is estimated to be anywhere from 50% to 80%. On the other hand, if a person with bipolar disorder is thinking about having children, there are still good odds that the child will not have bipolar illness. So the genetic determinants of the illness are complicated. \n\n6. How is bipolar disorder treated? \n\nThe cornerstone of treatment is medications that treat acute manic, depressive or mixed episodes, and which, in the long run, attempt to prevent the recurrence of these episodes. Such medications include lithium, divalproex (Depakote) and, more recently, some of the atypical antipsychotics as well as antidepressants. \n\nPsychotherapy plays an important role in improving the course and outcome of this illness in people. In particular, those with bipolar disorder often have strained relationships with loved ones because of their experiences during manic or depressive episodes; psychotherapy can help repair these torn relationships. In addition, psychotherapy can educate people about the signs and symptoms of their illness, how to pay attention to warning signs and how to nip emerging episodes in the bud. Psychotherapy can also help individuals cope with the stress that can sometimes precipitate manic or depressive episodes. \n\n7.

{"question": "What is Diptheria?", "patient_answer": "Diphtheria is an upper respiratory tract illness characterized by sore throat, low-grade fever, and an adherent membrane of the tonsil(s), pharynx, and/or nose. A milder form of diphtheria can be limited to the skin. It is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, an aerobic Gram-positive bacterium.\n\nDiphtheria is a highly contagious disease spread by direct physical contact or breathing the secretions of those infected. Diphtheria was once quite common, but has now largely been eradicated in developed nations (in the United States for instance, there have been fewer than 5 cases a year reported since 1980, as the DPT (Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis) vaccine is given to all school children). Boosters of the vaccine are recommended for adults because the benefits of the vaccine decrease with age; they are particularly recommended for those travelling to areas where the disease has not been eradicated yet.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nThe respiratory form has an incubation time of 1-4 days. Symptoms include fatigue, fever, a mild sore throat and problems swallowing. Children infected have symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, chills, and a high fever, although some do not show symptoms until the infection has progressed further.\n\nLow blood pressure may develop in some patients. Longer-term effects include cardiomyopathy and peripheral neuropathy (sensory type)[1].", "doctor_answer": "Diphtheria is a contagious illness caused by a type of bacteria. It can cause breathing and swallowing problems and can damage the heart and central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)."}
{"question": "what is Fifth Disease?", "patient_answer": "It is a infectious disease-mostly kids get--with a rash on feet, hands and mouth--it goes away in about 14 days--no big deal", "doctor_answer": "What is \"fifth disease?\"\n\nFifth disease is a mild rash illness that occurs most commonly in children. The ill child typically has a \"slapped-cheek\" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a \"cold\" a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days.\n\nWhat causes fifth disease?\n\nFifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Pet dogs or cats may be immunized against \"parvovirus,\" but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. Therefore, a child cannot \"catch\" parvovirus from a pet dog or cat, and a pet cat or dog cannot catch human parvovirus B19 from an ill child.\n\nCan adults get fifth disease?\n\nYes, they can. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease.\n\nIs fifth disease contagious?\n\nYes. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash.\n\nHow does someone get infected with parvovirus B19?\n\nParvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to \"just have a cold.\" The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. In a household, as many as 50% of susceptible persons exposed to a family member who has fifth disease may become infected. During school outbreaks, 10% to 60% of students may get fifth disease.\n\nHow soon after infection with parvovirus B19 does a person become ill?\n\nA susceptible person usually becomes ill 4 to 14 days after being infected with the virus, but may become ill for as long as 20 days after infection.\n\nDoes everyone who is infected with parvovirus B19 become ill?\n\nNo. During outbreaks of fifth disease, about 20% of adults and children who are infected with parvovirus B19 do not develop any symptoms. Furthermore, other persons infected with the virus will have a non-specific illness that is not characteristic of fifth disease. Persons infected with the virus, however, do develop lasting immunity that protects them against infection in the future.\n\nHow is fifth disease diagnosed?\n\nA physician can often diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical examination. In cases in which it is important to confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to parvovirus B19 and other germs. If immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to parvovirus B19 is detected, the test result suggests that the person has had a recent infection.\n\nIs fifth disease serious?\n\nFifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy. Joint pain and swelling in adults usually resolve without long-term disability.\n\nParvovirus B19 infection may cause a serious"}

{"question": "what causes the hiccups?", "patient_answer": "A hiccup or hiccough (generally pronounced \"hiccup\" independent of the spelling) is an involuntary spasm of the diaphragm; typically this repeats several times a minute. The sudden rush of air into the lungs causes the glottis to close, creating the \"hic\" noise. A bout of hiccups generally resolves by itself, although many home remedies are in circulation to shorten the duration, and medication is occasionally necessary. By extension, the term \"hiccup\" is also used to describe a small and unrepeated aberration in an otherwise consistent pattern. The medical term is singultus.\n\nWhile many cases develop spontaneously, hiccups are known to develop often in specific situations, such as eating too quickly, taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal, eating very hot or spicy food, laughing vigorously or coughing, or drinking an excess of an alcoholic beverage. Hiccups may be caused by pressure to the phrenic nerve by other anatomical structures, or rarely by tumors.", "doctor_answer": "Irrition to your diaphragm causes hiccups. \n\nThe diaphragn pulls down when you inhale to help pull air into the lungs, and it pushes up when you exhale to help push air out of the lungs. \n\nBut when your diaphragm gets irritated it pushes up in a jerky way causing a hiccup."}

{"question": "Why are there so many terrible psychiatrists?", "patient_answer": "I could answer this several different ways.

Doing heat pack will also help to aid the blood flow temporarily.  One important thing to remember though is that the source of tightness might be completely unexpected.  If you have cold hands, it may be more helpful to stretch your calves or your shoulders depending on your body structure rather than the hand itself.  You must remember to treat your body as a whole.  Chemical reasons could come from your diet or the air you breathe or any other intake (eg. tobacco or drugs).

{"question": "Do I need a counselor...?", "patient_answer": "It is very difficult to change the behaviors of others. It is much more effective to think about why this bothers you so much, and to change the way you feel about and react to their arguing. Family counseling might not be a bad idea if your other family members agree that this is a problem and are interested in changing. But counseling does not work unless those involved have a legitimate interest in changing themselves. I suggest calmly discussing with your family how much of a problem this is for them, and find out if they are interested in changing THEMSELVES rather than changing OTHERS. If so, counseling is for you. If not, you could certainly consider going by yourself to work on strategies to deal with the stress and anxiety this causes you.", "doctor_answer": "I think counseling would be a great place to start, and also perhaps some family couseling.  Look through the phone book for family counselors.\n\nGood luck to you."}
{"question": "Why is your pee yellow?", "patient_answer": "having clear urine is not necasarily a sign of good health. however having dark yellow urine is a sign that you need to drink more water, although some medications cause dark or even discolored urine .the yellow color is a result of the oxidants left over from not only the digestive process but also the metabolization process going on through the entire body...... slightly yellow to medium yellow urine is perfectly normal. if it's dark yellow dont panic right away, just drink more water. and see what that does.", "doctor_answer": "You are not drinking enough water if your urine is yellow. If you don't drink enough water, your organs do not have enough flushing agents to clean themselves. The yellowish tint is from byproducts from your digestive system. I sign of good health is clear urine."}

But you cannot change your hand size, or foot size or height.\n\nIn some cases, people that have dwarfism have painful surgeries tha streth the long bones of their leg to provide additional height.

{"question": "when reaching climax is it normal not to release fluids, and if so is this a medical condition?", "patient_answer": "Yeah! Don't worry about it, it tends to be something found in a lot of women. If it is a problem, I would suggest investing in a lubrication (I, personally, use Astroglide), it cuts down on the painful friction. Otherwise I wouldn't worry a bit about it.\n\nYeah, even after orgasm, if you don't produce any extra fluid don't worry :P Some women produce none, a little, and some can even ejaculate like a man (I think Howard Stern actually had a woman come in and show him how she ejaculated, ew) But it's not a problem when you don't, I don't really either, and everything down there's functional. If you are that worried, get it checked out, it's better to be safe than sorry. In my studies in human sexuality, though, I have never come across a disease in which too little \"juice\" is a predictor of any problems, or pregnancy down there.", "doctor_answer": "It's absolutely normal, I second what Kristy had to say. There is no standard for a certain amount being excreted during or post-orgasm. Everybody's different! Seeing a professional might be a good idea if you notice a change in color, smell, or consistency of your own secretions as it could be indicative of an infection or STD of some kind. Regular gyno exams and being familiar with your own body are essential to staying on top of its care. But any detail provided in your question does not seem to be cause for concern at all."}
{"question": "How can I beat depression?", "patient_answer": "It depends on what type of depression it is.  Generally some type of therapy will help, talking about it with professionals or friends.  It's also good to keep active doing things that help you feel good, and are healthy like excercise or recreational activities.  Drugs and alcohol make it worse, as does sleeping all day (which is probably what you want to do).  If the depression is chemical, then anti-depressants can be helpful, but I think that should be only as a last resort when you are sure it's a chemical problem.  I had a bad bout of severe depression, which turned out to be a chemical problem that runs in my family.  I finally took anti-depressants in combination with therapy and am doing great now.", "doctor_answer": "Do things that boost your self-esteem. I tend to interact with positive people and get more involved with activities. It keeps my mind occupied and I have little time to think about what depresses me."}

{"question": "What is a heart murmur?", "patient_answer": "I personally was diagnosed with one a few years ago was sent to a cardiologist who said it was nothing to worry about it.  Since then, it was not detected when I had physicals.  I know many people who were diagnosed with them and they were nothing.\n\nHere's some info from webmd:\n\n\nIn particular, they occur in many healthy children, who may or may not outgrow them as adults. They may also occur during pregnancy. Such murmurs are called \"innocent\" heart murmurs. They are not associated with medical or heart conditions, and do not require treatment or lifestyle changes.\n\n\nThough many murmurs are innocent, some may indicate serious heart problems. For instance, heart murmurs may be caused by blood flowing through a heart valve made leaky or narrow by disease. Murmurs can also be caused by increased blood flow across a valve as a result of medical conditions such as anemia or hypothyroidism. Congenital cardiac defects (heart problems present at birth) can also cause heart murmurs. These often can be repaired with surgery.\n\nWithin the heart there are four chambers separated from each other by valves, or flaps, that regulate how much blood enters each chamber at any time. Healthy valves also help prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction in your heart.\n\nA healthy heart makes a \"lub-dub\" sound as it beats. The \"lub\" (systolic sound) happens when part of the heart contracts and the mitral and tricuspid valves close, and the \"dub\" (diastolic sound) occurs when part of the heart relaxes and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. A heart murmur is an extra sound, such as a whooshing, in the heartbeat caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves.\n\nHeart murmurs can be heard through a stethoscope and often are detected during routine physical examinations. On further examination, your doctor may find that the heart murmur is innocent. If your heart murmur is related to more serious heart problems, your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist). Medication or surgery may be recommended to treat the underlying problem. He or she may also suggest that you take extra precautions against getting a heart infection, such as by taking antibiotics when you have dental work or some surgeries. With thorough examination and proper tests, your doctor should be able to tell what causes your heart murmur.\n\nSymptoms\nMany people with heart murmurs experience no symptoms. However, some murmurs can occur in conjunction with these other symptoms:\n\n    * Chest pain\n    * Rapid heartbeat (palpitations)\n    * Breathlessness\n    * Fatigue\n    * Bluish skin color or fingertips (sometimes seen in babies with congenital heart defects)", "doctor_answer": "it is a hole in the heart"}

You could have diabetes, and have some viral synovitis, or inflamation of the knee joint -", "doctor_answer": "I'm not sure but many forms of diabetes hinder the body's ability to ward off infection.

{"question": "Is there any effective and simple cure for (obstructive) sleep apnea?", "patient_answer": "Sorry to say but there is no simple cure for obstructive sleep apnea. The common regimen for obstructive sleep apean is CPAP. CPAP is Continuous Positve Airway Pressure. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs from closure of the glottis (a little flap in your throat that). CPAP will continously keep that open as to prevent it's shutting down to the trachea (your breathing tube). It is worth going through this. Afterall, it is your breathing.

There's tons of over the counter ones. You can also sit in a hot tub, try for the sauna action with all the steam. To make that even better, they have these tablets you put in the bottom of your shower that are full of eucalyptus or mentholatum, and that breaks it up too, just ask at your local pharmacy. Mint teas help soothe and release, and cayenne, horseradish, garlic and ginger all have things that work up into the sinuses to help stop the phlegm from running down the back of your throat, so as much as you can stomache in soup, etc works wonders.

{"question": "should a 2 year old get 12 mg of methadone by iv.?", "patient_answer": "Assuming that this child weighs around 25-30 pounds (11-14 kilograms), a typical STARTING DOSE of IV methadone would be 1.1-1.4mg given 2 to 6 times per day.\n\nIf the child has been treated with increasingly high doses of methadone (or other drugs like morphine, fentanyl, or Dilaudid) for a long period of time, it is possible that the methadone dosing could progress to very high doses, such as the 12mg you mention.  Examples where this might happen would include treatment of cancer or sickle cell disease.\n\nHowever, 12mg of IV methadone in a 2-year-old who does not regularly take very high doses of narcotic pain relievers would be totally inappropriate.  This would put the child at great risk of serious side effects (i.e. he/she may stop breathing or suffer serious cardiovascular problems).", "doctor_answer": "Why would a 2 year old get 12 mg of methadone by iv at all? I am assuming that this child is suffering pain of some kind.\n Though to tell you the truth I have never heard of a child getting this drug. It is just becoming popular as a pain medication in the neurology field in the past few years as it is not as toxic to your system as some drugs. As for SHOULD this child get that amount... I can't say. How often, why, to many other questions I guess. I take 90mgs daily for chronic pain and will be adjusting that slightly higher soon.

{"question": "How can I get rid of gallstones without having surgery?", "patient_answer": "Most gallstones are made of pure cholesterol.  You might try a diet with low fat and very low saturated fats.  Reducing the saturated fats will lower blood cholesterol and may (I'm not promising anything!) make the stones smaller.\n\nLowering your total fat intake may also help reduce or prevent pain.  Gallstones hurt because when you eat fat, the stomach senses it and tells the gallbladder to release some of the gall into the intestines to help digest the fat.  If you have stones, that squeezing is about like squeezing a handfull of pointy rocks.\n\nHowever...   I've had the surgery and it really isn't a big deal.  There is minimal scarring and the incisions aren't that much bigger than a bug bite or a medium sized zit.  \n\nIf you leave the gallstones there, they can get large enough to damage the gallbladder, with the result of a bad infection and that can cause death, which is a very Bad Thing!", "doctor_answer": "They now have a way of zapping them with sound that caused them to shatter instead of operating.

{"question": "WHat kind of sit-up is the best and most effective?", "patient_answer": "Well, situps are a waste of time.  Some people do like as much sit ups as they can to achieve that 6 pack.  And to be honest, some never get it.  Its cuz the muscles arent big enough to show a 6 pack.  There was never enough resistance to get it.  I dont recommend any type of sit ups.  I do a kung fu style push up that gives you the best results.  Imagine, everybody can do like 10 or 20, maybe 100 sit ups, but with this, some cannot even do one.  But, just because you cant do one doesnt mean you havent done any work.  Eventually, after trying every day, you will be able to do one.  And then 2, 3, and slowly you work your way to like 25.  You only need to do about 15 to 20 per day to keep that 6 pack after its there.  You lay flat on the floor on your stomach.  Then you prop your feet up in push up position.  Now you put your hands out there on the floor.  Now put them together so that they are just touching.  Now, try to do a push up.  Keep your back as straight as possible.  When you first do this, your back will have a tendency to bend because you are trying to do at least one.  Hehe.  Um, I used to be able to do 50 of these easy.  After I get it, it was a cinch.  It will take you like 1 to 2 minutes a day trying to do like 20.  Thats all it takes to keep your 6 pack.  I used to do crunches.  Elbows to knees.  They arent bad, but this is far better.  Because doing crunches, you might not be able to sit on the floor with your legs out, and lift your body with your two hands without touching the floor.  With these push ups, after you get the hang of it, you can lift yourself off the ground, with your legs parallel to the ground.  This is when you know that you are on your way.  Its the fastest, the best, and the only one that pin points right at your stomach.  Good luck.  Once there, you will need to work a difference excercise for that 8 pack.  People dont say 8 because they dont believe it exists.  It does, and I have it.  I will assist further when you are ready.  Just make sure you rate me hehee...", "doctor_answer": "crunches!!!

You could be prone to diseases because of acidity or lack of vitamins - possibly something like scurvy.  \n\nJust a few suggestions (hoping you don't mind):\n\n- take some vitamin & mineral supplements daily if you really hate fruits & vegtables. You especially need to take in more vitamin C since you aren't getting it from fruit & vegetables.\n\nTry to at least get some of these in....\n\n- Try smoothies with frozen fruit & juice. You can also add  milk or yogurt to make it creamy. Add some honey if you have to. Mix with a hand blender. You can also buy instant ones now.\n\n- There are some pretty yummy frozen vegetables with sauce out there that are fast.   \n\n- Keep fruit around as a snack or buy canned fruit salad. You can also try dried fruit.\n\n- Keep pre-packaged mini carrots and celery with dipping sauce handy. \n\n- If you really hate the taste of vegetables...then add many herbs or strong tasting sauce to disguise the taste.\n\nSorry to sound like a mom! Please see a doctor or nutritionist. Take care of yourself.", "doctor_answer": "In my opinion, eating no fruits or vegetables (highly alkalinic foods) *on a PH scale*, youre most likely keeping your body's PH acidic, thus making it easyly suceptible to various diseases... Some people live short periods of time no matter how many veggies or fruits they eat.. So in a way of putting it, it could be all up to destiny :), Take Care ;)"}

{"question": "What is the best cure for endometriosis?", "patient_answer": "There is no cure for endometriosis. But there are many treatments, each of which has pros and cons. It is important to build a good relationship with your doctor, so you can decide what option is best for you. \n\nPain Medication \n\nFor some women with mild symptoms, no further treatment other than medication for pain may be needed. For women with minimal endometriosis who want to become pregnant, doctors are saying that, depending on the age of the woman and her amount of pain from the disease, the best thing to do is to have a trial period of unprotected sex for six months to one year. If she does not get pregnant in that time, then further treatment may be needed. \n\nHormone Treatment \n\nFor patients who do not wish to become pregnant, but need treatment for their disease, their doctors may suggest hormone treatment. Hormone treatment is most effective when growths are small. Hormones can come in pill form, by shot or injection, or in a nasal spray. There are several hormones used for this treatment including a combination of estrogen and progestin such as birth control pills, a progestin alone, Danocrine (a weak male hormone), and GnRH agonists (gonadotropin releasing hormone). \n\nBirth control pills control the growth of the tissue that lines the uterus and often decrease the amount of menstrual flow. They usually contain two hormones, estrogen and progestin. Once a woman stops taking them, the ability to become pregnant returns, but the symptoms of endometriosis also may return. Some women take birth control pills continuously, without using the sugar pills that signal the body to go through menstruation. When birth control pills are taken in this way, the menstrual period may stop altogether, which can reduce pain or get rid of it entirely. Some birth control pills contain only progestin, a progesterone-like hormone. Women who can't take estrogen use these pills to reduce menstrual flow. With these pills, some women may not have pain for several years after stopping treatment. All birth control pills might cause some mild side effects like weight gain, bleeding between periods, and bloating. \n\nDanocrine has become a more common treatment choice than either progestin or combination hormone pills. Side effects with Danocrine include oily skin, pimples or acne, weight gain, muscle cramps, tiredness, smaller breasts, breast tenderness, headaches, dizziness, weakness, hot flashes, or a deepening of the voice. Women on Danocrine probably will only get a period now and then, or might not get it at all. Women who take Danocrine also should take steps to prevent pregnancy because it can harm a baby growing in the uterus. Because other hormones, like birth control pills, should be avoided, health care providers recommend that you use condoms, a diaphragm, or other \"barrier\" methods to prevent pregnancy. \n\nGnRH agonists (used daily in a nose spray, or as an injection given once a month or every three months) prevent the body from making certain hormones to prevent menstruation. Without menstruation, the growth of endometriosis is slowed or stopped. These medications can cause side effects, such as hot flashes, tiredness, problems sleeping, headaches, depression, bone loss, and vaginal dryness. Most health care providers recommend that a woman stay on a GnRH agonist for about six months. After that time, the body will start having a period again and a woman could get pregnant. But, after that time, about half of women have some return of their endometriosis symptoms. \n\nSurgery \n\nSurgery is usually the best choice for women with extensive endometriosis, or those with severe pain. There are both minor and major surgeries that can help. Your doctor might suggest one of the following surgical treatments: \n\nLaparoscopy - also used to diagnose the disease, your doctor can treat you with this surgery as well. If your doctor is going to treat the endometriosis during this surgery, he or she must make at least tw", "doctor_answer": "Pregnancy. However, it's hard to get pregnant when you have endometriosis. Be careful with Lupron Depot it lowers your hormones which can cause bone problems.\n\nYou can also have surgery to remove them but they'll just come back. See a Reproductive Endocrinologist and try to get pregnant. If you wait too long for pregnancy it may not happen.\n\nStay hopeful and prayerful."}
{"question": "what are the duties of GYNAECOLOGIST?", "patient_answer": "Some of the more common operations that gynaecologists perform include:\n\ntermination of pregnancy \ndilation and curettage (removal of the uterine contents, for various reasons, including miscarriage and menorrhagia; procedurally very similar to the above); \nhysterectomy (removal of the uterus); \noophorectomy (removal of the ovaries); \ntubal ligation; \nExploratory laporoscopy or laporotomy (used to diagnose and treat sources of pelvic and abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, vaginal bleeding, etc.) \ncolposuspension ('tightening' of the ligaments around the vagina, a common therapy for incontinence and discomfort in older women); \nLarge Loop Excision of the Transition Zone (LLETZ), where the surface of the cervix, containing pre-cancerous cells identified on Pap smear are removed).", "doctor_answer": "Gynaecology is a typically a consultant specialty. In most countries, women must see a general practitioner first. If their condition requires knowledge or equipment unavailable to the GP, they are referred to a gynaecologist. However, in the United States, law and many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care, and some women select that option.\n\nAs in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history and examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, and that it involves special equipment -- the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus and ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. Virgins are not usually examined vaginally. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigations\nSome of the investigations used in gynaecology are:\n\nabdominal ultrasound, to give a low-power view of the pelvic organs. \nvaginal ultrasound. A probe is passed into the vagina, which allows a detailed view of the uterus and its contents. \nblood tests. Levels of hormones such as estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and progesterone are measured, as well as prolactin. \nhysteroscopy -- a fine tube is passed into the uterus via the cervix under a general anaesthetic. \nlaparoscopy -- tubes are passed into the peritoneal cavity, which is then insufflated with carbon dioxide. This is commonly used to diagnose endometriosis. \nMRI and CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare. It can be used to delineate the uterine cavity with an injected dye (hysterosalpingogram) and to measure the pelvic girdle.\n\n\nDiseases\nThe main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are:\n\ncancer of the cervix. The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is a means of detecting this, by obtaining a sample of cervical epithelial cells and examining them under a microscope for malignant changes. All women are encouraged to have pap smears at regular intervals after commencing intercourse. \nincontinence of urine. \namenorrhoea (absent periods) \ndysmenorrhoea (painful periods) \ninfertility \nmenorrhagia (heavy periods). This is a main indication for hysterectomy. \nprolapse \nObviously there is some crossover in these areas. Amenorrhoea in a young girl may be referred to a paediatrician, incontinence to a urologist."}

{"question": "what is a trans sexual???", "patient_answer": "A transsexual is an individual who plans to have or who has had SRS (sexual reassignment surgery) or hormone therapy.  Contrary to popular belief they don't all want to transition b/c they're a man trapped in a woman's body, or a woman trapped in a man's body.  Nor does everyone know from a very young age that they want to transition and not every transsexual hates the body they were born with.  There are complicated reasons other than that related to an individual's desire to transition.  Transsexuals can be heterosexual, gay, lesbian, bisexual, or any other sexuality.  Eventually however their bodies will reflect their gender with the help of the methods listed above and this new body is different from the sexed term assigned to the body  and the person at birth.", "doctor_answer": "I just want to clear up some misconceptions here:\n\nA transsexual is a person who self-identifies as a person of the opposite sex from what they were born as.  Both male-to-female and female-to-male transexuals exist, but MTF is more common.\n\nIt takes hormone therapy and surgery to completely change one's sex.  People who choose to undergo the transistion are often required to live with their new identity for a year before doctors will allow any surgery to be done.  People who have not had the surgery are called pre-op transexuals, as opposed to post-op.\n\nTransexuality actually has nothing to do with who the person is sexually attracted to, only the sexual identity of the person.  This is probably the hardest thing to grasp for non-transexuals as our sexual preference is the most over-riding part of our sexuality.  \n\nWhat Dr. Dee refers to is a pre-op transexual.  They normally can't \"play a man\", as the breast tissue has already increased to a size that would require disguise to revert back.  \n\nHowever, people can be born as hermaphrodites (people with both male and female sexual parts).  Often when this occurs, the doctor doing the delivery will arbitrarily assign gender - sometimes not even informing the parents."}

The thickening of the wall can be due to abnormal growth and arrangement of muscle fibers.  Because the heart is a muscle, overuse can also thicken the heart wall.  This is why the left ventricle - the chamber that pumps freshly oxygenated blood out of the heart - is usually the location of most thickening.  \n\nSince this is a progressive disease, there can sometimes be no symptoms at all.  However, as the disease progresses, the thickened walls leave less room for blood in the chambers.  This can lead to distinct signs of abnormal heart function, which include breathlessness, angina (chest pain), syncope (fainting) after strenous exercise, pounding heartbeat, or fatigue.  The diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is complicated with the condition left ventricular hypertrophy - which is an enlarging of the left ventricle.  This is common in athletic people, due to heightened conditioning.  However, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be properly diagnosed with an ECG and chest x-ray.\n\nThe best plan of action is to have a regular electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest x-ray in order to catch the disease before it gets unmanageable."}

{"question": "What is diffence between AIDS an HIV??", "patient_answer": "Hi!!\n\n\"HIV is the virus that may causes AIDS. HIV belongs to a subset of viruses called retroviruses or slow virus. \n\n\n \nThis is because it is a progressive disease. HIV is entered through the body through the mucous membranes or thru blood to blood contact. \n\n\nOnce you get the virus it slowly begins to attack the immune system, killing off healthy immune system cells. The deterioration and destruction of immune function leads to AIDS. \n\n\nAIDS is the final stage of the HIV infection. A person is said to have AIDS when the cd4 counts drops below 200 and or a person has 1 or more opportunistic infections. The OIs, as they are called, are normal infections that a healthy person would be able to fight off. \n\n\nThe four stages of the HIV infection are as follows: \n\n\n1) The period following infection is called the window. It is called this because it reflect the window of time between infection and that which antibodies are devlop in a person. The HIV test looks for antibodies not the virus. \n\n\n2) The second stage is called seroconversion. This is when the body begins to develop lots of antibodies to fight off the virus in the body. During this period a person may have flu like sympton. Also during this period is said to be very infectious. \n\n\n3) The third stage is called symptom free. During this period a person may have no sympton what so ever. This can last any where from 6 months to well over ten years. The medical world is not sure why some people are living sympton free for so long. \n\n\n4) The final stage is called AIDS. This is the period when TCELL drop to below 200 and the OI\"S are present. \n\n\nSo, as we see, HIV is a infection that will leads to AIDS. \n\n\nThe body immune system is slowly being attacked until it is destroyed and can't fight off infections. Once this happens a person is said to have AIDS. AIDS is the final stage.\"\n\nI hope the above answers your question.\n\n>>> Naveen Kumar", "doctor_answer": "AIDS (Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome) is a fatal disease caused by a rapidly mutating retrovirus (HIV) that attacks the immune system and leaves the victim vulnerable to infections, malignancies, and neurological disorders.\n\nHIV or Human Immunodeficiency Virus is a retrovirus that causes AIDS by affecting the very immune system cells (T4 lymphocytes) that would ordinarily fight off such a viral infection. HIV is not transmitted by casual contact; transmission requires a direct exchange of body fluids, such as blood or blood products, breast milk, semen, or vaginal secretions, most commonly as a result of sexual activity or the sharing of needles among drug users. Such a transmission may also occur from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth. Saliva, tears, urine, feces, and sweat do not appear to transmit the virus."}

{"question": "after having showers with hot water or getting hot(due to blankets) during sleeping i get an allergy?", "patient_answer": "I suffer from the same thing.\n\nIt's hives.  \n\nIt can be an allergic reaction - if you're having other symptoms of allergies like watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, then it could just be an extension of whatever you're allergic to.\n\nBut hives can be brought on by heat without an allergic reaction.  Nobody knows for sure why it happens in the absence of other allergies.  But heat brings blood to the surface of the skin and allows hives to develop.\n\nIf you scratch them, they will spread.  Sometimes mine itch when they're just flat red wheals, and sometimes they don't... but if I so much as touch a wheal before it swells, POOF! Not only does it swell and itch a lot worse, but it tells all its friends and neighbors, and it spreads like wildfire.\n\nI have had chronic hives for 6 months now - due to allergies.  I take a Claritin and a Singulair every day, and it still doesn't completely get rid of them.  I am undergoing allergy shots.\n\nOne other thing you can do is to get some Ivarest. You can find it at Walgreens. I've tried everything else on the market, and only Ivarest keeps the hives down for longer than an hour or so.  It's a little more expensive, but a tube will last me several weeks, instead of just a day or two like a tube of Benadryl cream.\n\nYou can also take Benadryl before a shower to help keep the hives down to a minimum.\n\nIf you don't get relief of them within about six weeks, go to the doctor and get tested for allergies.", "doctor_answer": "I had the same problem when I was child so my doctor told me I should having shower with warm water 3 times a week and after shower you have to put some cream to your body and never sleep with hot blankets so try some soft sheets and also never wear kind of things that make your body hot ALWAYS wear 100% cotton."}
{"question": "what does it mean when diastolic blood pressure is over 100?", "patient_answer": "It means you need to quit eating salted food, lose weight, and exercise.", "doctor_answer": "If this is not a once-off measurement, but that your diastolic pressure has been checked a few times and it is definitely still over 100 mmHg, it means that you have high blood pressure.\n\nNormal blood pressure is now considered as a systolic blood pressure of below 120 mmHg plus a diastolic blood pressure of below 80 mmHg.\n\nDiastolic blood pressure is the blood pressure when your heart is relaxed in between the beats; compare that to the blood pressure when the heart is beating, which is called the systolic blood pressure. That is why the diastolic blood pressure is always quoted lower than the systolic blood pressure. Which of the two is more important is still up for discussion."}
{"question": "Do you feel that face transplants are morally acceptable? Especially in cases of severe disfigurement?", "patient_answer": "What kind of question is this? A face transplant is no different than an organ transplant in that it is an operation that drastically increases the quality of life for the recipient.\n\nI add to this that there has only ever been one face transplant done in the history of medicine. A woman received a donor face because her own face was eaten by her dog. This all happened earlier this month.\n\nThis happened with the blessing of the donor's family and thanks to these brave doctors the woman can now go out in public and eat (she couldn't keep food in her mouth when she had no cheeks).\n\nHow on earth could this be considered morally unacceptable?\n\nAs for Manar's ascertation that criminals will get face transplants to avoid prosecution (I think that's what he was getting at, it's hard to tell when the grammar is so bad), this is absolutely ridiculous. It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars for one of these operations, not to mention that it's not like the movie \"Face Off.\" It requires months of recovery coupled with the attention of the world-wide press.\n\nHonestly, some of these questions are ridiculous.", "doctor_answer": "In my opinion I wouldn't want someone else's face on mine. Life is life we have to learn to accept what happens in it. Those that love us will still love us no matter what happens to our face.

{"question": "why do we fart?", "patient_answer": "QUOTE: \"Well, for starters, the gas that makes up a fart comes from two sources: more originates from the breakdown of food by the digestive system, and some is from swallowed air. In the first case, foodstuffs are broken down by enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria in order for the energy in them to be made available to the body. Through the processes of digestion and fermentation, gases can be liberated from what's eaten. In the second case, air that a person swallows from eating, drinking, breathing, chewing gum, and being stressed, among other ways of entry, that's not expelled during a burp travels through the stomach and intestine, transforming into fart-ready mode. In either case, the gases flow down through the rest of the digestive tract and eventually exit the body - Poof! Ping! Pfft! Toot-toot! Kaboom! - expelled as a fart, or farts. And this silent or noisy expulsion of air can help bring about some relief and comfort from a buildup of gas within the lower part of the body.\"", "doctor_answer": "What exactly is a fart? The word \"fart\" can stand for: Frequency Actuated Rectal Tremor. Farting, also known as flatulence, is the act of passing intestinal gas from the butt. Intestinal gas comes from several sources: air we swallow, gas that seeps into our intestines from our blood, gas produced by chemical reactions in our guts, and gas produced by bacteria living in our guts. Burps are not farts that come out your mouth. They have to do with your stomach."}

What it has most likely is just a regular common cold caused by adenovirus or a rhinovirus.  No medicine will cure you of this.  ITs just time.  \n\nBabies are obligate nasal breathers, and when they get a cold, and get stuffy, they have a bit more trouble, and make it seem worse than it is.  Suction that nose often, and you can use saline drops to help lossen some of the snot.  \n\nTo prevent the flu from the influenza virus - keep your baby away from sick people, wash your hands prior to touching the baby, and keep breast feeding.", "doctor_answer": "The best way to help prevent influenza infection is to get an influenza vaccination each year, usually in early November. Unfortunately, immunization (administration of vaccine) against influenza is approved only for infants 6 months of age and over.\n\nUntil your infant is old enough to take vaccinations, you should look into home remedies and try to look for baby food with some of these ingrediants.

{"question": "Is it true you should not work out the same muscle group every day?", "patient_answer": "Working out the same muscle group every day just makes the muscle larger or blukier. Tissue are packed into highly arranged bundles. When you work out you are actually contracting and relaxing the tissue that makes up the muscle. As you move your muscle some of the tissue break down causing the pain and friction. Resting a day between working out just gives time for the muscle to repair the broken down tissue. The benefit is that since some of the tissue had broken down when you work out the next day you rely on other tissue  that has not broken down in the muscle group to raise the weight that you are raising. The muscle will eventually get bulkier if you do it that way and it will be pretty painful because the tissue will eventually be broken down. Doctors don't usually recommend you to work out the same muscle group every day because they believe that the muscle should be fully repaired before you work out.", "doctor_answer": "In the Army, they would have us do an Easy Day, then a Hard Day.  Easy Day was basic warm-up followed by soccer or whatever.  Hard Day was warm-up followed by multiple mile run, workout in the gym, whatever.  They feel that it is required.\n\nAs for the muscle burn, that happens because you are burning the muscle and fat, to my understanding.  Depending on whether you are trying to build-up your muscles, gain tone, or lose weight, you will get different effects for different types of workouts."}

That's the best way to PREVENT the cold to begin with, making it the cheapest overall remedy.\n\nHere's something interesting: once you're showing the symptoms of a cold (sneezing, body aches, runny nose, etc.) you've already HAD the cold and your body is casting off the byproducts of the virus.\n\nAnd, because a cold is based in a virus, you don't really catch the same cold again.

Children's body fatness changes over the years as they grow. Also, girls and boys differ in their body fatness as they mature. This is why BMI for children, also referred to as BMI-for-age, is gender and age specific.1, 2 BMI-for-age is plotted on gender specific growth charts. These charts are used for children and teens 2 – 20 years of age. For the 2000 CDC Growth Charts and Additional Information visit CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nEach of the CDC BMI-for-age gender specific charts contains a series of curved lines indicating specific percentiles. Healthcare professionals use the following established percentile cutoff points to identify underweight and overweight in children.\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/bmi-for-age.htm", "doctor_answer": "Well first off you really can't go by the charts tey use now because they are really outdated.

Some ethnicities tend to be heavier than others. She may also have big bones (tho some people think that's a cop-out). And then there's genetics. If there are a lot of heavier people in her family then chances are she's gonna be heavier too no matter what she does. And then her metabolism also plays a factor. If her metabolism is slow then she's just gonna be heavier. But if she's only 5 feet tall then hopefully she's not TOO heavy. Because that could cause heart problems for her. But since she's twelve she's still growing so it may balance out for her."}

{"question": "What is Rieke?", "patient_answer": "It is spelled Reiki and pertains to the use of energy to heal the body.\n\n\"Reiki is a form of Japanese spiritual healing.  This complementary medicine has its foundation in ancient Tibetan Buddhism, apparently forgotten until its rediscovery in the late 19th century.  The aim of reiki is to promote health, maintain well-being, and help people attain a higher consciousness.  Practitioners draw on \"reiki energy\" channeling it to areas of need in themselves and their patients.  They borrow terminology from physics, claiming that reiki acts at an atomic level, causing the body's molecules to vibrate with higher intensity and thus dissolving energy blockages that lead to disharmony and disease.  \n\nA treatment session lasts about an hour; the practitioner directs reike energy through his hands to the patient.  The patient lies clothed on a treatment table and the practitioner holds his hands on or over the body in 12 basic positions for about five minutes each.  This is said to balance the body's energy centers or \"chakras.\"  Some patients may feel relaxed after treatment; others feel invigorated.\"\n\nTo get in touch with your own energy body as a beginner, I recommend T'ai Chi. You can find classes at the YMCA or, sometimes, through the  adult education programs in American cities.", "doctor_answer": "i'm guessing you mean reiki?  healing by gentle touch and lots of love."}

Below is some information you might find helpful. I myself had two eye surgery to correct this before I was 2 years old.\n\nWhat is strabismus?\nIf your baby's eyes seem to point in different directions or not focus on the same object, he may have strabismus — a lack of coordination between the eyes. They may appear to be \"crossed\" or one may seem to drift inward, outward, or upward. Strabismus can be constant (meaning the eyes are always crossed or misaligned) or intermittent (meaning it happens now and then).\n\nWhat is amblyopia?\nAmblyopia (also called lazy eye) develops when the brain shuts off or suppresses vision in one eye. This can happen if your baby's eyes are misaligned or if he can't see as well with one eye because of nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, or something that's blocking clear vision in that eye, like a cataract or a drooping eyelid.\n\nAbout 3 to 6 percent of children under the age of 6 develop amblyopia. Treatment is most successful before age 5 or 6, although recent research shows that even older children may recover their vision. If ignored, though, amblyopia can result in permanent vision loss.", "doctor_answer": "This sounds like a vestibular problem to me.

{"question": "please explain about types of leukemia?", "patient_answer": "There are several types of leukemia. They are grouped in two ways. One way is by how quickly the disease develops and gets worse. The other way is by the type of blood cell that is affected.\n\nLeukemia is either acute or chronic. In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are blasts that remain very immature and cannot carry out their normal functions. The number of blasts increases rapidly, and the disease becomes worse quickly. In chronic leukemia, some blast cells are present, but in general, these cells are more mature and can carry out some of their normal functions. Also, the number of blasts increases less rapidly than in acute leukemia. As a result, chronic leukemia worsens gradually.\n\nLeukemia can arise in either of the two main types of white blood cells: lymphoid cells or myeloid cells. When leukemia affects lymphoid cells, it is called lymphocytic leukemia. When myeloid cells are affected, the disease is called myeloid or myelogenous leukemia.\n\nThese are the most common types of leukemia:\n\n1.Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. This disease also affects adults, especially those age 65 and older. \n2.Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in both adults and children. This type of leukemia is sometimes called acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). \n3.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most often affects adults over the age of 55. It sometimes occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. \n4.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurs mainly in adults. A very small number of children also develop this disease. \n5.Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon type of chronic leukemia. This and other uncommon types of leukemia are not discussed here.

A double clinical study of patients with nonspecific sore throat tested licorice tea (throat coat brand) and found a significant reduction in throat pain as compared with placebo in as little as 10 minutes.  Patients were told to consume this tea 4-6 times per day.\n\nLicorice tea will probably also help with the pain of the mouth sore, even if it does not make the sore heal faster, but it might help with that too.\n\nLicorice has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, which may help with the blister.\n\nOne warning, though,  is that you should not consume too much licorice, especially if you have blood pressure problems.  A case report from the Netherlands reported that excessive consumption of licorice tea (about 3 liters per day, so a lot) can temproarily raise blood pressure.

This of course means taking advice from someone in a professional enough position to comment on your condition (e.g. how bad it is). Sure, you may need medication or you may not. Why do you refuse to take drugs anyway? You know eventually you may not even have a choice in taking some. Have you thought about that?\n\nOverall, my opinion is that I think the first thing you need to do is forget about 5 minute solutions. Depression doesn't work like that.

{"question": "Can drinking to many diet cokes cause an ulcer?", "patient_answer": "It sure can - read this... it tells you what else can cause ulcers and explains what an ulcer is.  My uncle had to stop soda altogether because of this (good luck!):\n\nAn ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. \n\nThere are two main types of ulcers- \n\nPeptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. \n\nDuodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. \n\nHow do you know if you have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. \n\nIntense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. \n\nThere may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. \n\nThere are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium \"H. pylori\" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. \n\nSome medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding. \n\nTense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. \"The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide\" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. \n\nAlthough uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. \n\n\n\nWhen a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage. \n\nIf you find the above mentioned symptoms, contact the doctor. Immediate medical attention should be given if the patient is vomiting blood, has cold skin accompanied by sweating, faintness, weakness, or is experiencing extreme pain. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for prompt healing and also to prevent the ulcer from coming back. \n\nThe above is provided for your information, but you are responsible for your own actions to deal with your ulcers or gastro esophageal health problems.

There remain significant differences in life expectancy between men and women in the US and other developed countries, with women outliving men.

{"question": "please suggest ways to get rid of pimples in my upper body . I am 27 yrs old.?", "patient_answer": "As annoying as they are, the best treatment I found was to not touch them at all!  The skin in that area is very prone to scarring because it is so thin and delicate.

{"question": "Is there a way to SAFELY have sex with a new partner without spreading genital warts to them?", "patient_answer": "HPV can be spread even without a condom.  Unfortunately there is no way to protect yourself 100% from HPV, although the risk is reduced if a condom is used.  HPV can be active in the skin, even though there are no warts present.  This means that you (or your partner) can have the virus and not even know it.  It stands to reason then, that HPV is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections.  My family doctor told me to just assume that everyone who has had more than 2 sexual partners in his/her lifetime has it.\n\nUPDATE: Based on later answers, I wanted to address mutual m*sterbation.  You CAN get HPV from mutual mast.  HPV warts can be microscopic, invisible to the naked eye.  If you touch your partner's genitals and then touch your own with the same hand, you have most likely just put the HPV virus on your own skin.  Whether or not you will develop warts/lesions is unpredictable.  Some people have HPV but never show any lesions.", "doctor_answer": "Wearing a condom helps, but nothing is 100% safe."}

{"question": "How large will my penis grow?", "patient_answer": "Use a medical traction device such as the Andro Penis. This method is based on exerting a gradual tractive force of 600 to 1500 grams to permanently expand the blood-carrying chambers (the largest being the corpus cavernosa) of the penis. This results in an increase in the total tissue volume and thus an enlargement of the penis. \n\nUse the Andro Penis device 4-9 hours per day for 3-6 months. You will have time-linear flaccid and erect gains in length, and less pronounced gains in girth. The flaccid gains appear first.\n\nI've gained permanently 1.75\" length and 1\" girth since June 2005 through the use of an Andro Penis medical traction device and PowerJelq for exercises. Try it, and you will be happy to see serious gains after 3-6 months usage.", "doctor_answer": "Most male penises are between 5-7 inches long.

{"question": "what is the oxyhemoglobin disassociation curve?", "patient_answer": "The oxygen dissociation curve is a graph that shows the percent saturation of hemoglobin at various partial pressures of oxygen.  Commonly a curve may be expressed with the P50  value.  This is a value which tells the pressure at which the erythrocytes are fifty percent saturated with oxygen.  (Bouverot, 1985).  The purpose of an oxygen dissociation curve is to show the equilibrium of oxyhemoglobin and nonbonded hemoglobin at various partial pressures (Oxygen Dissociation Curve).  At high partial pressures of oxygen, usually in the lungs, hemoglobin binds to oxygen to form oxyhemoglobin.  When the blood is fully saturated all the erythrocytes are in the form of oxyhemoglobin.  As the erythrocytes travel to tissues deprived of oxygen the partial pressure of oxygen will decrease.  Consequently, the oxyhemoglobin releases the oxygen to form hemoglobin (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997).  \n\nThe sigmoid shape of the oxygen dissociation curve is a result of the cooperative binding of oxygen to the four polypeptide chains.  Cooperative binding is the characteristic of a hemoglobin to have a greater ability to bind oxygen after a subunit has bound oxygen (Oxygen Dissociation Curve).  Thus, hemoglobin is most attracted to oxygen when three of the four polypeptide chains are bound to oxygen.  \n\n \n\nFactors that Influence Oxygen Binding\n\n    *\n\n      Temperature- Increasing the temperature denatures the bond between oxygen and hemoglobin, which increases the amount of oxygen and hemoglobin and decreases the concentration of oxyhemoglobin (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997).  The dissociation curve shifts to the right.\n    *\n\n      pH- A decrease in pH (increase in acidity) by addition of carbon dioxide or other acids causes a Bohr Shift.  A Bohr. shift is characterized by causing more oxygen to be given up as oxygen pressure increases and it is more pronounced in animals of smaller size due to the increase in sensitivity to acid (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997).  The dissociation curve shifts to the right.\n    *\n\n      Organic Phospates- 2,3-Diphosphoglycerated (DPG) is the primary organic phosphate in mammals.  DPG binds to hemoglobin which rearranges the hemoglobin into the T-state, thus decreasing the affinity of oxygen for hemoglobin (T and R State).  The curve shifts to the right.", "doctor_answer": "The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is an important tool for understanding how our blood carries and releases oxygen. Specifically, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve relates oxygen saturation (SO2) and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PO2), and is determined by what is called \"hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen,\" that is, how readily hemoglobin acquires and releases oxygen molecules from its surrounding tissue."}
{"question": "What is the true color of our Blood?", "patient_answer": "In humans and other hemoglobin-using creatures, oxygenated blood is a bright red in color. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red, which can be seen during blood donation and when venous blood samples are taken. However, due to an optical effect caused by the way in which light penetrates through the skin, veins typically appear blue in color. This has led to a common misconception that before venous blood is exposed to air it is blue.", "doctor_answer": "the blood whke in the body is blue because i has not hit oxygen. when you get cut and it hits oxygen it than turns red."}
{"question": "What is pre-Hipertension?", "patient_answer": "Hypertension (defined as a blood pressure >=140/90 mmHg) is an extremely common comorbid condition in diabetes, affecting ~20–60% of patients with diabetes, depending on obesity, ethnicity, and age. In type 2 diabetes, hypertension is often present as part of the metabolic syndrome of insulin resistance also including central obesity and dyslipidemia. In type 1 diabetes, hypertension may reflect the onset of diabetic nephropathy. Hypertension substantially increases the risk of both macrovascular and microvascular complications, including stroke, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, and possibly neuropathy. In recent years, adequate data from well-designed randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of aggressive treatment of hypertension in reducing both types of diabetes complications.\n\n\nIf your blood pressure is between 120/80 mmHg and 139/89 mmHg, then you have PREHYPERTENSION. This means that you don't have high blood pressure now but are likely to develop it in the future. You can take steps to prevent high blood pressure by adopting a healthy lifestyle.", "doctor_answer": "Hipertension is high blood pressure so pre- means that you are borderline in getting high blood pressure."}

Unfortunately, the cessation of sweat during exercise may be a symptom of overheating, or heat exhaustion.  That can lead to some detrimental health effects as well as death."}

Do I ask another crevice sniffer to check for me?  Is that proper?  and how do you know someone is a crevice sniffer without flat out asking them?", "doctor_answer": "No. And try as I might, I probably won't be able to. Because of this abnormalty called \"anosmia\" I have no sense of smell. I can taste, but I can't smell. Oddly enough, it kept me from joining the NAVY. But I don't let that one sense keep me from learning as though I had it. True, it is a lot slower learning if you cannot smell, but I might as well learn what I can and react accordingly. BTW, I learned something today. Thanks, girl."}
{"question": "when you are searching for a doctor to treat you, what are the main criteria that you will look for?", "patient_answer": "The doctor should be patient to hear your symptoms.

{"question": "what can U do to stop a headache?", "patient_answer": "alcohol.", "doctor_answer": "For me, when a headache starts, laying down in a cool, quiet, dark room with an ice pack helps.  If you are getting frequent headaches, watch your caffeine intake (some headache medications contain caffeine) and also be careful with Tylenol. Both of these can cause rebound headaches.\nAnother thing I find helpful is a headache balm.   They can be found at natural food stores or online at many natural soap or handmade beauty stores.  You can also purchase ingredients to make your own. Effective essential oils for headaches include peppermint, lavender, eucalyptus, rosemary, and melissa. Below is a link to a balm that Origins makes."}

{"question": "Progressive lenses - Are they worth it or will I still want 3 different pairs of glasses?", "patient_answer": "It might take a little getting used to because progressive lenses don't give you quite as big of a field of view in the center of the lens.  I don't think I've ever heard of a person not thinking that progressives were worth it.  If you aren't sold on the idea, another option is a trifocal, but you don't get quite the versatility with that as you do with a progressive.

{"question": "Why do I have body odor that won't go away?", "patient_answer": "It's the food you're eating!!!\n\nTry eating more greens and fish.\n\nI went to Germany, and wow did they smell bad.

Funky meat (like hotdogs and hamburgars) produces B.O. \n\nThen I went to Greece straight from Germany.  In athens, they mainly eat lots of greens (some call these vegtables),seafood, and Vino (wine).  The Greeks smelt really good. . . Yummy, I'd take a yummy smelling Greek God any day!\n\nTo get more greens, you can eat vegtables, go to Jamba Juice and take shots of Wheatgrass, or buy chloriphorm in a pill. . .

{"question": "why do your fingers get wrinkled when you get out of the water?", "patient_answer": "The skin of your fingers absorb water/ fluid and swell also.", "doctor_answer": "The skin of your finger consists of tiny little skin cells, 100's and 100's of millions of them.  Each cell is so small you would need a powerful microscope for looking at 100 of them.\n\nAll cells are surrounded by a membrane.  Somewhat like a very, very tiny balloon filled with salty jello.  The insides of the outermost cells are salty and dehydrated because your skin grows from underneath, the dermis, close to the capillaries (blood supply).\n\nThe outer skin, called the epidermis, consists of cells which are wearing out and drying up, although they are mostly not quite dead yet.  The very oldest ones that are dead come off when you scrub or shower. Some are falling off all the time, but they are so small you do not see them.\n\nSince the epidermis consists of rather dry cells, it is able to absorb water.  The cell walls allow the water in your tub, shower, or pool to penetrate into each cell.  The insides, being salty, are have a strong affinity for water.  \n\nIf you spend a long time in the water, the epidermal cells swell up, increasing in size, somewhat like the the balloons mentioned earlier being filled with more water.\n\nWhen the skin on the outside of your hands or toes swells it has more surface area than previously.  Instead of being like a tight fitting glove, it becomes more like a glove that is too big.\n\nIf you put on a glove that is too big, it will have wrinkles instead of being stretched smoothly.\n\nThe entry of water into a cell is called osmosis.  If you stay in fresh water for an extremely long time, many cells will absorb so much water they will burst.  That is called lysis.\n\nRed blood cells are much more fragile than skin cells.  When combined with fresh water they rapidly absorb so much water that they all appear to dissolve.  Each one of the millions and millions of red blood cells has burst.  That is called hemolysis.\n\nRopes made from plant fibers are also composed of cells.  Test a rope:  See if it shrinks in length when absorbing water or drying out.\n\nWhen the skin on your fingers and toes dries out, the cells shrink in size, and the skin becomes more smooth and taut, like a tight, well fitted glove.\n\nYour skin is very important.  Without it you would be just like a raw piece of meat, ready for the flies and germs to eat.\n\nTake good care of your skin.  Do not get sunburned.  When you have a bad cut that is healing, you should try to keep your hands out of dirty water or ponds.\nThese contain potentially dangerous bacteria that could infect your open or healing wound.\n\nTaking a shower or washing your hands in clean water is okay.  Just be sure to put antibiotic ointment and a fresh bandage over the cut when you are done.\n\nYour teacher might be able to show you some pictures of bacteria (germs) or let you look at live ones through a microscope.  \n\nOnly one person is allowed to look through at a time.  Everyone else must stand back and not push the observer or touch their head.  Otherwise you could injure one of their eyes or both by knocking them into the eyepiece or binoculars of the microscope.\n\nSome people have gone blind that way.  No horsing around !!  Strictly enforced.\n\nDuring winter, good skin care means putting lotion on your hands and wearing gloves while outside in the cold winter air.\n\nPeople who drink a carrot milkshake daily, made in a blender, have very beautiful skin once they have done this for six months.\n\nHealthy skin makes both boys and girls look better."}

{"question": "how fast can i see results from doing sit ups?", "patient_answer": "First, you should stick with crunches..they are less stressful on your back and focus more on the correct muscles. Then, if you cut out all fat from your diet and limit your caloric intake, you will see results in 3 - 4 weeks. That is, if you are doing a serious ab routinue of at least 25 minutes/day (with 1 day off a week).\nIf you have a not-so-healthy eating lifestyle, doing sit ups will not help and you will most likely not see any results unless you are doing a complete ab workout (obliques, crunches, roman chair, scissors, leg lifts, etc.) for at least 2 hours/day. \nThe best way is to cut fat (soda, junk food are the easiest) and gradually build into a harder and harder workout where you start at 3 sets of 30 sit ups for a week and add one set and 10 reps per set every week. In ten weeks, you will have a solid workout that will produce very good results. With every workout routine, you should be doing a cardio-vascular exercise (running, biking, brisk walking) to burn calories. And always consult a doctor for the proper workout schedule for your age and body type.", "doctor_answer": "It really depends on your diet.  If you are burning more calories during the day than you consume, you will lose weight (to a point), and eventually see abdominal definition.  Genetics also play a significant role on how hard you will have to work (look at family members).  It also depends on how good a shape you're already in, and what other exercises you're doing.  For example, if you have a huge chest, the sheer circumference difference will make your waist look smaller."}
{"question": "what are the causes of hirsutism in newborns ?", "patient_answer": "In addition to the very helpful links provided by the earlier poster, it may be that newborns appear \"hairy\" without having a disorder (usually the term hirsutism implies an abnormality). \n\nA developing fetus is commonly covered with hair called lanugo hair during gestation. This hair is thought to have some insulating properties and be there because babies lack insulating fat at this time. About 36-40 weeks of gestation this lanugo hair is shed and replaced with vellus hair, a soft, peach fuzz looking hair. Some\n\nHere is a picture of a newborn with lanugo hair still present: http://www.babylink.info/Edinburgh/FAQ/..%5Cimages%5CLanugo1.jpg\n\nIf the newborn is premature it may still be covered with lanugo hair, which will eventually be shed. It may also be that the vellus hair is mistaken for abnormal hair on a newborn.

{"question": "how does 1 get rid of chronic constipation?", "patient_answer": "Try getting a good amount of fiber everyday.  Eat it or take it at the same time.  There are cereals with the daily dose you need also otc medicines you can use everyday.  If this doesn't work ask a doctor.", "doctor_answer": "Constipation, infrequent or irregular bowel movements, is no fun for anyone. It can be painful and uncomfortable. Constipation can be attributed to at least one of several factors: poor eating habits, lack of exercise, not eating enough fiber or drinking enough fluids, and even possibly serious illness.\n\nFortunately, there are things one can do to prevent constipation.\n\nSince dehydration can lead to constipation, one should always drink at least eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day. It’s best to avoid caffeine since it causes dehydration and can act as a diuretic. Those who do enjoy caffeinated beverages on a regular basis should do so in moderation.\n\nA healthy diet is key for preventing constipation. A high fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts ensures regularity. Consuming an apple every day, with its skin intact, is another sure way to prevent constipation. Guava is another helpful fruit, but it should be eaten with its seeds to ensure the full effect. Starchy foods should be avoided when one is constipated as this will only escalate the problem.\n\nRegular exercise will also assist in one’s quest for regularity. Even if it’s a daily stroll in the park, exercise is important.\n\nIf you’re feeling a little backed up, perhaps one or some of these remedies can help.\n\nLaxatives – There are many over the counter products to choose from in price ranges and formulas to suit everyone’s personal preference. If you’re not sure which product is right for you, check with your pharmacist or physician. Either is sure to recommend the product that is right for you. \nLemon and Honey – Mix two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of honey into a glass of warm water. Drink one glass in the morning and one in the evening to bring back regularity. \nOrange Juice and Olive Oil – Drink a glass or mug filled with half each of orange juice and olive oil. It may not taste great but it will have your plumbing running smoothly in no time. \nLicorice – Licorice has laxative qualities. Eating several pieces of real licorice will help to relieve your constipation. \nGrapes – A large bunch of grapes should do the trick. \nCastor oil and honey – Honey seems to appear in many remedies for constipation. In addition to taking it with lemon and even by itself, one can also mix one teaspoon of honey with one teaspoon of castor oil. \nSomething else a person who is suffering from constipation can try is a cup of tomato juice mixed with half a cup of sauerkraut juice and a quarter cup of carrot juice. It may not have a pleasant flavor, but it works great!\nWhen it comes to constipation, the important thing is to have a proper diet, drink water often throughout the day, and exercise on a regular basis. If your constipation lasts for longer than a week, contact your physician. In the meantime, why not try one of the above remedies?"}

{"question": "what is nuclear medicine?", "patient_answer": "Nuclear medicine is a branch of medicine and medical imaging that uses unsealed radioactive substances in diagnosis and therapy. These substances consist of radionuclides, or pharmaceuticals that have been labelled with radionuclides (radiopharmaceuticals). In diagnosis, radioactive substances are administered to patients and the radiation emitted is measured. The majority of these diagnostic tests involve the formation of an image using a gamma camera. Imaging may also be referred to as radionuclide imaging or nuclear scintigraphy. Other diagnostic tests use probes to acquire measurements from parts of the body, or counters for the measurement of samples taken from the patient. In therapy, radionuclides are administered to treat disease or provide palliative pain relief. For example, administration of iodine-131 is often used for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis and thyroid cancer.\n\nNuclear medicine imaging tests differ from most other imaging modalities in that the tests primarily show the physiological function of the system being investigated as opposed to the anatomy. In some centres, the nuclear medicine images can be superimposed on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight which part of the body the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated in. This practice is often referred to as image fusion.\n\nNuclear medicine diagnostic tests are usually provided by a dedicated department within a hospital and may include facilities for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. The specific name of a department can vary from hospital to hospital, with the most common names being the nuclear medicine department and the radioisotope department.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine", "doctor_answer": "it consist of Radiation therapy to Nuclear body imaging studies.\n\nthey use molecular level of study to find out the disease or treatment modalitis."}

However, you put them in everyday and take them out everynight.  If you get one tiny (miniscule - as in you can barely see it without a microscope) scratch or rip, you will have to through it away.  And your contact could fall out at any blink (nothing is more fun than having 20 people on their hands and knees looking for something the size of a dime on shag carpet!).

{"question": "Would I have had a herpes outbreak by now??", "patient_answer": "I say you get off the internet and get checked out you may have something more serious than herpes with a fever and diarhea. Drs. have to be confidential about your problem so go out of town if your scared someone will see you at the clinic.", "doctor_answer": "It can take up to two to three weeks for herpes to erupt with physical lesions after being infected, so it is possibly too soon to have an outbreak.  However everyone responds differently to herpes in the initial infection phase, and some people never break out (about 25%), and many only have very mild symptoms, yet they are contagious (called asymptomatic viral shedding).  So even if you don't see an outbreak, that doesn't mean you don't have herpes.  If you had contact with someone who you think might have had herpes, you should get tested as soon as you do see any kind of lesion, where they can sample the fluid directly and test it for herpes virus.  If you don't break out, you need to wait about 8 to 12 weeks from the time you were exposed to get a blood test done for herpes antibodies.  It will tkae that long for your body to produce a detectable level with high certainty.  Be sure to get an antibody test for both herpes 1 and 2, that tests for IgM antibodies.  The standard in this case is a test called the the HerpeSelect antibody test."}

However my mother told me that they get better afyter you have a baby.  I am not sure about that.  I am pregnant.

This is the best book available for depression.\n\nTry to get therapy if you can.  If you can't afford it, there may be resources available to help you.

{"question": "i am 36 $ my optometrist said that my vision has improved, but at about 40 it might need bifocals any insights", "patient_answer": "regular eye exams every 2 years are a good idea for many reasons, especially to detect glaucoma (easily treated with eye drops) and to detect changes in your vision. If you do end up at 40 with less than perfect vision, then bifocals are a great idea and only take a week or 2 to get used to. Without corrected lenses you will not be able to pass eye exam to get your driver's lisence and you will be impaired at reading and while driving. Also, I recommend getting a separate pair of glasses with just the reading portion of your prescription to use while using your computer. That way you don't have to tilt your head for hours. I also recommend getting a pair of sunglasses made to your distance prescription to keep in your vehicle. Bifocals at 40 are a good thing because they stop your vision from further deterioration.", "doctor_answer": "Is your Optometrist named \"Homey the Clown\"?"}

Also you may be sore the next day.", "doctor_answer": "Well, it won't be a walk in the park when he works on you, depending upon your problem. Still, when I go, I feel almost instant relief when he adjusts my neck. The main thing to remember is to be sure to ice down as he tells you following the procedure or else you will swell & be rather uncomfortable. It is also a good idea to take it easy...& I mean EASY... after the procedure. This allows everything to relax into place & you will feel MUCH better for it.\n\nNormally the first visit is to take x-rays & determine the problem so you are sort of eased into the visit by doing that. They'll probably do some kind of adjustment but won't always do something major the first time out...it all depends upon the problem, really.\n\nOverall, the first time or three are somewhat uncomfortable & can be even more so afterward but, once you've gone a few times you'll find you lok forward to it :)\n\nGood luck!"}

You catch STD's when you have unprotected sex - period.", "doctor_answer": "You can always catch an STD.  So if you've had an STD and are cured, you're not immune from catching it again.  \n\nHaving HIV will not cause an STD to come back.  That being said, having HIV does make it easier to contract an STD because it lowers the immune system.  This doesn't only apply to STDs though, having HIV makes it easier to catch a cold or the flu as well for the same reasons."}

Too much caffeine, being ADD, or vitamin deficiencies can all cause you to not perform at your best.\n\nI recommend taking at the very least, one multivitamin a day to start. Also, regular exercise has proven to increase bloodflow to the brain which, in turn, increases memory retention. Finally there are a number of activities which help as well, I'll list a few here:\n\n- Crossword puzzles are very good for maintaining mental health.\n- Mental association exercises. You will need to get a book or do further research on this one. But there are mental tricks you can use to remember names, lists of objects, and so on. For instance, I use a name association to remember people's names. I think of some outstanding feature of a person when I meet them and integrate it (mentally) with their name. That and I repeat the name a few times in conversation. That is just one item though.\n- There are also a new breed of drugs hitting the market. Do a search for \"smart drugs\" or nootropics.

Does it really work?", "patient_answer": "Experts say writing down your eating habits will keep your diet on track -- even when you slip up and eat a few things you wish you hadn't.\n\nFood journals can help keep portions under control. For example, don't just write that you ate chicken for dinner. Write down how many ounces that piece of chicken was. And how many pieces you consumed.

{"question": "What's the best way to get rid of acne?", "patient_answer": "I would contact a dermatologist for the 'best' way.\n\nOther steps\n\n1. Wash your face at least twice a day with a mild cleanser. Use a pH-balanced cleanser without perfumes or too many chemical additives.\n \n2. Touch your face as little as possible, and only when your hands are clean.\n \n3. Avoid squeezing pimples. Bacteria on your hands or on unsterile equipment can lead to more blemishes and possible scarring.\n \n4. Steam your face once or twice a week to help open the pores. Boil water, remove the pot from the stove, drape a towel over your head and hold your face over the pot. Then rinse your face with cold water. \n \n5. Use essential oils such as calendula, chamomile, juniper, lavendar and mint directly on your skin. Mix 10 drops of any of the oils with 2 tbsp. soy or almond oil, and smooth a few drops on dampened skin.\n \n6. Try using herbs. Saw palmetto can help balance boys' hormones, while chaste tree berry can do the same for girls. Echinacea, alfalfa, burdock root, cayenne, chaparral and yellow dock root are also helpful.\n \n7. Consider other topical mixtures. Beat an egg yolk, apply it with a cotton ball and leave it on for 15 minutes. Alternatively, mix oatmeal and honey together to form a paste and apply it to your face. Oatmeal soaks up excess oil and honey soothes the skin.\n \n8. Take acidophilus to fight bacteria.\n \n9. Eat a diet high in fiber, including whole grains and fresh vegetables and fruits, to keep your body healthy overall and provide nutrients to your skin. Stay away from junk food, caffeine and salty foods.\n \n10. Determine whether specific foods aggravate your skin and eliminate them from your diet.\n \n11. Consider adding zinc supplements to your diet.\n \n12. Limit your exposure to the sun and reduce the stress in your life.", "doctor_answer": "get a good soap and do what the other guy said"}

Don`t worry if your teeth bleed when you floss you probably just haven`t flossed enough, and remember to brush for atleast 2-3 minutes.

{"question": "What is the best way to fight a headache?", "patient_answer": "Once you have it, advil or aspirin works well. An ice bag or hot pad on the forehead sometimes helps, or if it's tension-related, a neck or head massage can really decrease the pain. Drinking coffee or a caffeine soda will also get rid of headaches for many people--those who have taken in less than their normal dose of caffeine.\nFor me, and many people I know, headaches are virtually eliminated if caffeine is avoided. Once I realized that my weekend headaches were caused by drinking less coffee on weekends, I stopped drinking coffee and have no more than one headache a year.", "doctor_answer": "Lie down and close your eyes.

You may not feel like eating too much in the beginning & then feel like you want to eat the plaster right off of the walls because you get so hungry...part of what is happening is that your iron levels sag somewhat during this time. Normally, I won't eat much the first day or so but then I will do just about anything for a good piece of beef but everyone is different. Try to eat a lot of green leafy veggies dring this time as they will help you to feel better & do what you can to avoid caffeine as this will just make any cramps worse. Unfortunately, at this time of the month, all many women want is chocolate, soda & salty things...the chocolate & soda both have caffeine :) Yep, its a viscious cycle :)\n\nGood luck & welcome to your womanhood!"}
{"question": "what causes coughing in asthma?", "patient_answer": "Cough is a natural phenomena to bring out any foreign body or any secretion from the lower respiratory tract.  In asthma, there is narrowing of the lower respiratory tract, and the secretions are small in quantity and sticky in nature which also reduces the lumen of the respiratory tract. So to bring that expectoration out cough is produced.  Since it is sticky in nature the person  coughs severely.", "doctor_answer": "Some things that can trigger coughing in asthma patients are dust, cold air, overexcertion, perfume, pollen and other enviromental factors. People who have asthma have very sensitive airways,( Also known as RAD Reactive Airway Disease) so when they are exposed to an offending allergen they can start coughing or wheezing."}
{"question": "someone smokes marijuana for 30 years and suddenly stops.  What kind of withdrawal symptoms would be displayed", "patient_answer": "You did not say whether this person was a daily user or a recreational drug user. Are they using other drugs also? Do they use marijuana concurrently with alcoholic beverages? Marijuana in itself is not physically addicting. Behavioral mechanisms and social elements of lifestyle contribute to the perception of \"withdrawal.\" What prompted the individual to stop? Was it a life changing circumstance, social or economic pressure, or other compelling factors? Yes there will be anxiety from not having the familiar \"high\" and professional help in the way of counseling and medication may be needed. Seek advice from a trained professional. (MD, Therapist, Counselor)", "doctor_answer": "They hate the couch, swear off cheetoes and twinkies, have no sense of humor, they find stuff lost for years, and lose all thirst!\n\nok, so uhhhh seriously, as a general rule the withdrawal symptoms of any drug will usually be the opposite effects of the drug itself. Although pot will undoubtedly have some withdrawal symptoms physiologically, they are likely to be subtle...perhaps a reduction of appetite or some mild headaches. The more obvious is likely to be psychological...most notably irritablility, social dysfunctions, personality changes in general, etc...\n\nIf they have made a concious effort to stop, then good for them, its never an easy thing to do and good support of sober people is a must. One must rebuild friendships away from drug users to be successful. It becomes a sad and difficult process that will serve them well in the long run."}

{"question": "About men: does a mans' diet affect the apperance and consistecy of his essence(semem)?", "patient_answer": "Yes it does. It can be very difficult thing to control though. One way to make semen constantly sweeter is to eat an all-vegetarian diet. Other foods high in fructose sugars can also sweeten it, but they might interact with other things in the diet and not be as effective. A diet high in protein will make it stronger, almost like burnt leather. Drinking more water will cause men to produce more semen, but not as thick. Calcium is what makes semen thick, but I don’t know if you can change this by adding it to the diet.", "doctor_answer": "It sure does.  Drinking alot of coffee can make it bitter.

{"question": "I suffer from Erectile Dysfunction. Dr claimed it as BOTH physical, but more psychological. Any suggestions ?", "patient_answer": "Prostate problems can cause major erectile problems, and even problems with ejaculation. And if you are taking meds for bipolar disorder, those almost always cause problems with ejaculation, but not necessarily with erectile function.  You are not in the best of situations, because viagra would probably work well without the bipolar meds. The best course of action is a patient, willing, and caring partner, even if the sex is marginal because of your situation, and understanding and caring partner can help make it very good. A good psychological state and situation can make up for the physical problems - it won't really do much of anything to fix the physical problems, but it can make intimacy more enjoyable. Get creative, and be satisfied with what you've got. A selfish or non-understanding partner would probably not only be extremely stressful and unfulfilling, but probably would tell you a whole lot about them. The most ironic thing is that sexual dysfunction is severly underrearched and not understood very well - particularly physical causes. Until the more recent decades it was almost always assumed to be purely psychological.", "doctor_answer": "I have tired this product and it works.  I will simply refer you to my website."}

If you get them on a semi regular basis, go to a clinic or your regular doctor, they have an anti-viral pill that will help you greatly. Abreva and such only dry out the blisters, so does ear wax believe it or not. Most adults have the herpe virus in their system, but a smaller percentage have symptoms. Ice also breaks the virus down quicker once you have the blisters, and aspirin will reduce pain and take the swelling down. Don't ever break the blisters they are freakishly contagious.

{"question": "what are the main clinical features of gilbert syndrome?", "patient_answer": "Gilbert's syndrome: The only significant abnormality is mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is important clinically only because this disorder is often misdiagnosed as chronic hepatitis. The disorder, presumably lifelong, may affect as many as 3 to 5% of the population and is most often detected serendipitously in young adults with unrelated nonspecific complaints. Some family members may be affected, but a clear genetic pattern is often difficult to establish.\n\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain. There appear to be complex defects in the liver's uptake of plasma bilirubin, which usually fluctuates between 2 and 5 mg/dL (34 and 86 µmol/L) and tends to increase with fasting and other stresses. In addition, glucuronyl transferase activity is low; therefore, the disorder may be related to Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II. Many patients also have mildly diminished RBC survival, but this is insufficient to explain the hyperbilirubinemia.\n\nGilbert's syndrome can be easily differentiated from hepatitis by normal liver function tests, absence of urinary bile, and predominantly unconjugated bilirubin fractionation. Hemolysis is differentiated by the absence of anemia or reticulocytosis. Liver histology is normal, but biopsy is not needed for diagnosis. Patients should be reassured that they do not have liver disease.", "doctor_answer": "According to WebMD.com, Gilbert Syndrome is \"one of a benign (harmless) group of metabolic abnormalities, Gilbert Syndrome is a hereditary disorder leading to a defect in the clearance (removal) of bile pigment (bilirubin) from the liver.

{"question": "does drinking a lot of water kill your appetite? how often should i drink it?", "patient_answer": "No. It doesn't.\n\nThough no single formula fits all people, several guidelines are available to help you estimate how much to drink each day. Delve into your daily fluid needs to learn how your body uses water and what factors may increase — or decrease — your water requirements.\n\nLack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry on normal functions. Even mild dehydration — as little as a 1 percent to 2 percent loss of your body weight — can sap your energy and make you tired. Dehydration poses a particular health risk for the very young and the very old. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include:\n\nExcessive thirst \nFatigue \nHeadache \nDry mouth \nLittle or no urination \nMuscle weakness \nDizziness \nLightheadedness \n\nEvery day you lose water through sweating — noticeable and unnoticeable — exhaling, urinating and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you need to replace this water by consuming beverages and foods that contain water. So how much water, or more precisely fluid, do you need?\n\nThis isn't an easy question to answer. A healthy adult's daily fluid intake can vary widely. Most people drink fluid to quench thirst, to supply perceived water needs and \"out of habit.\" At least three approaches estimate total fluid (water) needs for healthy, sedentary adults living in a temperate climate.\n\nReplacement approach. The average urine output for adults is 1.5 liters a day. You lose close to an additional liter of water a day through breathing, sweating and bowel movements. Food usually accounts for 20 percent of your fluid intake, so you if you consume 2 liters of water or other beverages a day (a little more than 8 cups), along with your normal diet, you can replace the lost fluids. \nEight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Another approach to water intake is the \"8 x 8 rule\" — drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day (about 1.9 liters). The rule could also be stated, \"drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day,\" as all fluids count toward the daily total. Though this approach isn't supported by scientific evidence, many people use this basic rule as a guideline for how much water and other fluids to drink. \nDietary recommendations. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day and women consume 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages a day. These guidelines are based on national food surveys that assessed people's average fluid intakes.", "doctor_answer": "I have to disagree with most of the people I guess. Drinking cold water does suppress appetite because it sits in your stomach longer and makes you feel fuller. Your stomach has to heat it up before your body can process it, so it can trick your stomach into curbing the urge for munchies."}

This may occur because of cirrhosis or severe hepatitis.

This is when you are ovulating.\n\nHowever, if you want to know the best time of year to get pregnant I would say January-February or May-June. If you get pregnant in these months you will avoid being huge pregnant during the hottest months of the year and will avoid having your child too close to Christmas and the other holiday seasons.

{"question": "what is spinalcord lesions?", "patient_answer": "A. General comments\n\nThe complex of anatomy of the vertebral column and the great concentration of important tracts in a structure of small cross-sectional area are unique features related to spinal cord injury. A number of factors influence the severity of pathological changes and functional deficits after spinal cord trauma, including age and the flexibility of the body, the size of the bony canal as influenced by heredity, degenerative changes of joints and intravertebral discs and variations in blood supply. The spinal levels most commonly involved with injury are the lower cervical spine (C4, C5, C6, C7, T1) and the thoracolumbar juncture (T12, L1, L2), the areas of greater mobility. \n\nB. Pathophysiology\n\n1. The spinal cord and nerve roots may be injured by: \n\na. Compression from bone, ligaments, extruded disc material and tumors. \n\nb. Disruption or overstretching of neural tissues \n\nc. Edema following compression or concussion \n\nd. Disturbance of circulation \n\n\n2. Mechanisms of injury \n\n\na. Direct injury results from force applied directly to the back of the neck or trunk and may cause fractures of spinous processes of laminal arches, concussion of the spinal cord, or direct compression of neural tissue by depressed bone fragments. Lacerations can result from knife or bullet wounds. \n\n\nb. Indirect injury is a more common mechanism resulting from forces applied to the head and trunk or from movements that exceed the normal range, e.g. when the head is suddenly accelerated or decelerated in relation to the trunk. \n\nC. Pathological changes \n\nThe most common pathological changes are contusions, with necrosis, swelling and hemorrhage acutely to variable extents. Chronic changes include macrophages, gliosis and loss of architecture. In addition, edema may occur in areas that do not show contusions and infarction may result from impairment of circulation. Wallerian degeneration in distal axons will occur. \n\nD. Clinical signs\n\nNeurological symptoms vary from complete loss of function below the injured segments to temporary loss of cord function with complete recovery. Specific symptoms depend on the site of injury. e.g. posterior horn or column injury produces paresthesias, pain and other sensory disturbances; anterior horn or corticospinal tract damage results in weakness or paralysis. After denervation, fibrillations, fasciculations, muscle atrophy, and groups of atrophic fibers in a muscle biopsy will be seen. \n\nE. Types of injury\n\n1. Fracture dislocation of the spine \n\n2. Hyperextension or hyperflexion with cord compression by a displaced vertebral body fragment. \n\n3. Cervical spondylosis \n\n4. Intervertebral disc abnormalities and other osseous pathology, e.g. herniated lumbar disc \n\n5. Neoplasms (intramedullary or extramedullary)", "doctor_answer": "spinal cord \n\nThe spinal cord is a part of the vertebrate nervous system that is enclosed in and protected by the vertebral column (it passes through the spinal canal). It consists of nerve cells. The cord conveys the 31 spinal nerve pairs of the peripheral nervous system, as well as central nervous system pathways that innervate skeletal muscles.\n\nThe vertebral column consists of vertebrae described as belonging to 5 groups (called segments). These segments are (in order from top to bottom): the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae, and the sacrum and coccyx"}

Many herbs bottles say that their product hasn't been tested by the FDA and must deny any ability to cure. You can find lots of research nowdays. Kevin Trudeau has written alot on this subject.

{"question": "what are the symtoms of headache and stomachache,why it always happen to ladies and children most of the time?", "patient_answer": "The first answer seems to be correct.", "doctor_answer": "Headache:\n\nA headache is a pain in the head with the pain being above the eyes or the ears, behind the head (occipital), or in the back of the upper neck. Headache, like chest pain or back ache, has many causes. \n\nAll headaches are considered primary headaches or secondary headaches. Primary headaches are not associated with other diseases. Examples of primary headaches are migraine headaches, tension headaches, and cluster headaches. Secondary headaches are caused by other diseases. The associated disease may be minor or major. \n\nTension headaches are the most common type of primary headache. As many as 90% of adults have tension headaches. Tension headaches are more common among women than men. \n\nMigraine headaches are the second most common type of primary headache. An estimated 28 million people in the US have migraine headaches. Migraine headaches affect children as well as adults. Before puberty, boys and girls are affected equally by migraine headaches, but after puberty more women than men have them. Migraine often goes undiagnosed or is misdiagnosed as tension or sinus headaches. \n\nCluster headaches are a rare but important type of primary headache, affecting mainly men. The average age of cluster headache sufferers is 28-30 years, although headaches may begin in childhood. \n\nSecondary headaches may result from innumerable conditions, ranging from life threatening ones such as brain tumors, strokes, meningitis, and subarachnoid hemorrhages to less serious but common conditions such as withdrawal from caffeine and discontinuation of analgesics (pain killing medication). Many people suffer from \"mixed\" headache disorders in which tension headaches or secondary headaches may trigger migraine. \n\n\nStomach ache:\n\nPain in the belly (abdomen) can come from conditions affecting a variety of organs. The abdomen is an anatomical area that is bounded by the lower margin of the ribs above, the pelvic bone (pubic ramus) below, and the flanks on each side. Although abdominal pain can arise from the tissues of the abdominal wall that surround the abdominal cavity (i.e., skin and abdominal wall muscles), the term abdominal pain generally is used to describe pain originating from organs within the abdominal cavity (i.e., beneath the skin and muscles). These organs include the stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Occasionally, pain may be felt in the abdomen even though it is arising from organs that are close to but not within the abdominal cavity, for example, the lower lungs, the kidneys, and the uterus or ovaries. This latter type of pain is called \"referred\" pain because the pain, though originating outside the abdomen, is being referred to (felt) in the abdominal area. \n\nAbdominal pain can be acute and sudden in onset, or the pain can be chronic and longstanding. Abdominal pain may be minor and of no great significance, or it can reflect a major problem involving one of the organs in the abdomen. The characteristics of the pain--location, timing, duration, etc. are important in diagnosing its cause. Persisting abdominal pain should be evaluated by a physician."}

Go to the website and look up CESIUM CHLORIDE AND OXYGEN DROPS. The other ones could be green algae and paw paw, etc etc. These medicines are known in the medical field, but they dont talk about it. Because these are natural remedies with no toxic chemicals in it. So, thats why they cant profit from it. If they cant profit, they dont sell. I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies. They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing. What do you have to live with after chemo? Your body is not sunburned, its practically microwaved. CESIUM CHLORIDE can be taken with OXYGEN DROPS. Go to the websites. You can go to these websites and they will give a whole package for you to buy. You can take these medicines over the course of 3 months, a year, or whatever they prescribe.

{"question": "Why do I keep losing weight but my waist will not go down any further?", "patient_answer": "You need to target exercises on your abdominal muscles.", "doctor_answer": "In order to be succeed at thinning your waistline, you have to get a basic under standing of how the abdominal muscles function and how your body burns fat.\n\nThe first thing that you need to understand is the difference between fat and muscle tissue. Fat is created by eating excess calories and it is primarily stored in layers on top of your muscles. Muscle tissue consists of fibers that contract to produce movement.\n\nFat can't turn into muscle, and muscle can't turn into fat. But you can lose muscle mass while you gain fat. That's what happens to most people, especially as they begin to get a little older.\n\nSo if your goal is a trim waist line and a nice flat stomach, the first thing you need to do is remove the layers of fat that are sitting on top of your abs. Everyone has a flat stomach. It's just that some of them are covered with excess fat. \n\nThe most effective way to flatten your stomach is with a combination of strength training (placing an extra focus on the mid-section), cardiovascular exercises (short, intensive workouts), and a stable blood sugar level to keep you from adding even more fat (and it makes it easier for the body to use your body fat for fuel). \nYou have to do some type of progressive strength training. The ab muscle is primarily used to flex your torso forward. But there are also muscles that flex your torso to the side and other muscles that rotate it. Often you will see people on their ab roller every day doing lots of sit-ups or crunches. \n\nIf you want to effectively strengthen your stomach muscles you need to incorporate these exercises: \n  \n1-2 forward flexion exercises (sit-up, crunch, etc.) \n  \n1-2 side flexion exercises (side crunches, side bends, etc.) \n  \n1-2 rotational exercises (standing twists, trunk rotations, etc.)\n  \nYour abs are muscles, and just like any other muscles, they should be exercised at most 3 times per week. You also want to make sure you're training them progressively, which means working them harder each time. \n  \nIncrease metabolism using short, and hard, cardio workouts. Cardio workouts are very important because they can, if done properly, increase your metabolism for up to 24 hours or more!\n\nThis means that you're less likely to store any excess calories as body fat simply because they're more likely to be used up by your higher metabolism. Plus, you're more likely to burn off some excess body fat in the process! \n\nHere's a simple interval workout that you can do with just about any activity (bicycling, walking, swimming, etc).\n  \nWarm up at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes \n  \nPerform 30 seconds of hard exercise (almost as hard as possible) \n  \nperform one minute of moderate exercise (recovery time to catch your breath) \n  \nRepeat this process from 6-10 times \n  \nCool down at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes  \n  \nMaintaining a stable blood sugar level is the key. Most importantly, you have to stabilize your blood sugar level! This is by far the most important factor when it comes to shedding that excess body fat and keeping it off!\n\nTo stabilize your blood sugar level you have to feed your body frequently, about every 2-3 hours. The key is to give your body only the amount of food that it needs at that time. Your body burns calories all day long, so why would you only feed it once or twice a day?\n\nGive your body the fuel it needs: fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins (fish, lean beef, chicken, eggs, etc). \n\nMost people pay too much attention to how much fat is in food, or how healthy a meal is. Calories are calories. It doesn’t matter where they come from. If there’s extra it's going to body fat! \n\nI'm not saying that what you eat isn't important because it is. It just doesn’t have all that much of an affect when it comes to losing fat. Make healthy choices whenever possible, but don’t feel like every cheeseburger you eat is guaranteed to be st"}

The disease takes its less-scientific name from Lou Gehrig, a baseball player with the New York Yankees in the late 1920s and 1930s, who was forced to retire in 1939 as a result of the loss of motor control caused by the disease. \n\nIn 1991, a team of researchers linked familial ALS to chromosome 21. Two years later, the SOD1 gene was identified as being associated with many cases of familial ALS. The enzyme coded for by SOD1 carries out a very important function in cells: it removes dangerous superoxide radicals by converting them into non-harmful substances. Defects in the action of this enzyme mean that the superoxide radicals attack cells from the inside, causing their death. Several different mutations in this enzyme all result in ALS, making the exact molecular cause of the disease difficult to ascertain.\n\nRecent research has suggested that treatment with drugs called antioxidants may benefit ALS patients. However, since the molecular genetics of the disease are still unclear, a significant amount of research is still required to design other promising treatments for ALS"}
{"question": "what is the best way to stop snoring?", "patient_answer": "New Way to Stop Snoring\n\nSnoring is more than just a noisy inconvenience. Doctors say it can be a sign of a serious medical condition.\n\nSurgery or the use of a bulky face mask was the only proven way to quiet nighttime noise. But now there's new hope thanks to a new treatment called the pillar procedure. \n\nHow the Pillar Procedure works\nThe Pillar Procedure addresses one of the anatomical components of sleep apnea and snoring: the soft palate. During the Pillar Procedure, three tiny woven inserts are placed in the soft palate to help reduce the vibration that causes snoring and the ability of the soft palate to obstruct the airway. Once in place, the inserts add structural support to the soft palate. Over time, the body's natural tissue response to the inserts increases the structural integrity of the soft palate.\nhttp://www.restoremedical.com/pillar.asp", "doctor_answer": "sleeping face down does stop snoring.

{"question": "Can hypnosis therapy help with sexual inhibition or sexual dysfunction?", "patient_answer": "Yes, hypnosis can help.  It really depends on the issue being addressed.  Hypnosis is not a magic wand.  Sexual dysfunction is an interesting one because many times the cause is something physical. I have told people to see their doctor first and it turns out that they are diabetic or some other health related issue.  Dysfunction is one of the leading indicators that there are other things going on that need to be checked out.  If every thing is ok and you want a little boost, hypnosis can be great.  Doing it with your partner can be wonderful. Much of hypnosis is about belief and trust.  Making the avenues of communication and trust stronger between partners will always help. \n\nIn the case of inhibition, hypnosis is not mind control.  It can't be use to make you do something that you don't want to do.  It can be used to make you more comfortable with an idea that you chose to explore.  It can be use to help you explore why you are uncomfortable with a subject and if these inhibitions are something you want to modify.  Hypnosis is a tool to get to the solutions that you want arrive at.  Again, it is not a magic wand that will take you there.

It's not just producing too much or too little of a hormone, there are also secondary reactors that regulate the hormones produced that can fail. Try adjusting your diet, cutting out sugars and carbs, soy and pork and other things that have been known to tweak your thyroid, and replace them with things that help it. And be very careful when talking to doctors, get lots of opinions. It's still a fairly unsure area of medicine and there are a lot of different views.", "doctor_answer": "yes, the pituitary gland sends hormones to your brain. The hormones control the thyroid"}
{"question": "Why do I lose my voice everytime I get really stressed out or upset.

{"question": "What should I do about chapped lips?", "patient_answer": "The first step in preventing chapped lips is to stop licking. Constant wetting and drying sucks the moisture from lips' outer layer, causing them to feel dry, which prompts more licking, creating a vicious cycle. Dehydrated lips are also more susceptible to dry, windy conditions. \n-- A moisturizing lip balm, especially those containing dimethicone, will help retain natural moisture and protect dry, chapped lips. \n-- Drinking lots of water will help prevent dehydration, which may contribute to chapped lips and dry skin. \n-- Smoothing a generous coating of lip balm on lips before bed will help to moisturize lips while you sleep. \n-- The sun's UV rays are responsible for 90 percent of visible damage we commonly attribute to aging. A lip balm that contains a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 will help prevent sunburn during outdoor activities, and may reduce the risks of skin aging, skin cancer, and other harmful effects of the sun. \n-- Regular lipstick products, especially some long-wearing varieties, may feel drying. A base coat of lip balm will add needed moisture during winter months. \n-- If lips become chapped, avoid wearing lipsticks while lips are recovering as drying products in color pigments may irritate chapped lips. Also keep acidic foods from touching delicate lips until they've healed. \n-- Lip exfoliators such as Softlips Nightly Care(TM) buff away dry, dead skin cells and stimulate growth of new, vibrant cells. The interactive Beta Hydroxy formula of Softlips Nightly Care(TM) conditions lips that may be sensitive to strong Alpha Hydroxy chemical peels, and the overnight system helps reduce concern about sun damage to freshly exfoliated skin. \n\nFor more information and tips, see the website below!", "doctor_answer": "MEDICATED CHAPSTICK, I PERFER BEES WAX OR BLISTIC, U KNOW ANYTHING LIKE THAT."}

Do you hate to eat? Do you eat ice cream? Potato chips? Pizza? Anorexia is more than just being skinny. It is a way that people relate to food and eating. If you eat when you are hungry and don't worry about it, I would say you are just naturally skinny.\n\nWhen you start refusing to eat certain foods because they have too much fat, when you look at yourself in the mirror and think you look fat all the time, when you obsess about your figure... those are danger signs. If you don't really think about what you are eating, and don't ignore your hunger, you are probably just skinny.\n\nIts ok to be skinny unless you get there through unhealthy means.\n\nAnorexia - losing weight through not eating, \nand\nBulemia - throwing up after you eat\nare both unhealthy.

{"question": "why are cigarretes legal knowing they can cause cancer?", "patient_answer": "There are many things that are legal even though we think they may cause cancer. Like french fries. The law however does mandate, that there is a warning on cigarettes about their health risk. (Sort of the same thing as those warning on garages in California (\"this building contains chemicas known to the state of california to cause cancer or birth defects.\")). Anyways, the government can't make everything that is unhealthy illegal, nor can they coerce you into a healthy lifestyle. That would be against your civil rights. However, what they can do is tax these unhealthy things (like high taxes on tobacco and alcohol in most countries, high taxes on gas in Europe, etc.).", "doctor_answer": "lots of things are legal, even though they are harmful ,alchohol,cigarrets,even watching television. its not up to the government to decide what’s healthy for an each person. though they make life tough by taxes and laws(most Muslim countries ban alcohol as its against their religion, Singapore has high taxes on cigarretes)its up to you to decide .

{"question": "what is inguinal herina.should it treated or not necessary.explain other type of herina?", "patient_answer": "if you don't get it treated you will have very serious consequences that will eventually be fatal", "doctor_answer": "A hernia is a condition in which part of the intestine bulges through a weak area in muscles in the abdomen. An inguinal hernia occurs in the groin (the area between the abdomen and thigh). It is called \"inguinal\" because the intestines push through a weak spot in the inguinal canal, which is a triangle-shaped opening between layers of abdominal muscle near the groin. Obesity, pregnancy, heavy lifting, and straining to pass stool can cause the intestine to push against the inguinal canal.\n\nSymptoms of inguinal hernia may include a lump in the groin near the thigh; pain in the groin; and, in severe cases, partial or complete blockage of the intestine. The doctor diagnoses hernia by doing a physical exam and by taking x rays and blood tests to check for blockage in the intestine.\n\nThe main treatment for inguinal hernia is surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. This surgery is called herniorrhaphy. Sometimes the weak area is reinforced with steel mesh or wire. This operation is called hernioplasty. If the protruding intestine becomes twisted or traps stool, part of the intestine might need to be removed. This surgery is called bowel resection. (Bowel is another word for intestine.)"}

I think a rough estimation is that it takes about an hour to process half an once of alcohol, which is, if I'm not mistaken, the amount of alcohol in the average alcoholic beverage.

{"question": "where can i find the prognosis of and treatment for 4th stage lung cancer?", "patient_answer": "Dont listen to what doctors tell you.  They will only prescribe their pills and chemo therapy.  Its a dead end.  Instead, go look up Cesium Chloride, Paw Paw, Oxygen Drops, and Green Algae.  Their prognosis is not correct with them because everything is spoken with chemo in mind.  Even if you live after chemo, you dont expect to live anywhere more then 5 years.  the chemo deteriorates your health and body so that you cannot live much longer after that.  Insead look up the remedies that I have prescribed.  Please hurry as I am here to help you the best I can.  Go to the website below and they will even tell you what you need to buy.  Some people report a 90% cure rate, even when doctors have given up.  Imagine that.  So, why is it that these medicines are not prescribed to the dying?  Because of money.  These products cannot say anything about cancer on their labels because of the money reason.  But, their websites can tell you what its used for and for what cancers.  When these medicines come home, they are all in a plain medicine bottle with there name on it and thats it.  Call them up and they will tell you what you need.  you need to hurry as you dont have much time.  I wish you the best of luck.  There is more on this, but I dont want you to read too much.  CESIUM CHLORIDE CAN BE USED WITH OXYGEN DROPS FOR BEST RESULTS.  I want you to listen because I dont want them to do to you, what they did to my aunt and uncle, who both had liver cancer.  Good luck my friend", "doctor_answer": "A search of the internet will reveal the five year survival rates for this type/stage of disease (for stage IV nsclc they are not encouraging).  \n\nBut lots of variables are in play as to prognosis of the person you know (I am assuming it is you for the remainder of the answer).  Lots of things can enter the equation -- general physical health, type of lung cancer, other health conditions, where it has spread to, treatment choices, age, nutrition, etc.  And it is important to remember that even if the survival rates are low -- you could still be one of the survivors!\n\nI would start by seing a medical oncologist -- ideally one who tends to focus on lung cancers.  They will be in the best position to offer treatment alternatives and outlooks.  Think about what questions you want to answer and write them down before you go.  Take someone with you -- task them with being sure all of your questions get asked and have them take notes.  Don't hesitate to ask the doctor to slow down or provide more information.  If you are interested in prognosis and treatment alternatives -- ask!  Some patients seem to prefer less information in that area and some mds wait for the topic to be brought up.\n\nSome patients fight the disease with everthing medicine has to offer (some of which comes with significant side effects and/or contain invasive techniques).  Other choose to receive no medical treatment.  Still others pick and choose treatments with an eye towards quality of life rather than life extension.\n\nIf you are in the latter category, good questions to ask about any treatment approach (including no treatment) is: a) what is the impact on quality of life; b) what is the impact on life extension; and c) what are the potential side effects and how likely are they.  Regardless of your philosophy, communicate your approach to your doctor.  They are in the business of helping you and they can best meet your needs when they understand what they are.\n\nAlso, please remember that any decisions you make can be reversed -- you can start with very aggresive tx and back off if the disease responds poorly (or your body responds poorly to the tx).  Finally, allow you oncologist to help you with all of the symptoms -- some come from the disease while others can come from the tx.  Don't try and gut it out.  Let you md know about things like depression, anxiety, pain, appetite, nausea.  To some extent, these can be pretty effectively dealt with in the home.\n\nNow is also the time to consider things like what heroic measures you would like taken if you fall very ill and fill out forms such a DPA for health care. I think a great form to look at for ideas of care you might and might not want to see employed is at http://www.wsma.org/images/polst_form1.jpg as it helps step you thru the potential interventions."}
{"question": "does chronic sinusitis cause dizziness?", "patient_answer": "Not generally, no. However if the infection should get to your ears, which wouldn't be uncommon, it can affect the vestibular system, thus making you dizzy. Generally speaking, if you are having dizziness, you should see your doctor to get some antibiotics (if not taking them already) as an inner ear infection can do bad things if left unchecked. One should also consider the possibility that something else could be causing the dizziness at the brainstem...which would be really bad! Either case, see your Dr.", "doctor_answer": "Not directly.  But the same health conditions that cause chronic sinusitis can contribute to dizziness - which is generally caused by low blood pressure.  Drinking more water helps both - it keeps the sinus fluids moving to clear and prevent sinus infections, and it keeps the blood minerals balanced to keep your blood pressure up."}

Exercise increases your metabolism, burning more calories. It builds muscle which also burns more calories.\nTry to eat small meals several times a day in stead of 3 large meals. The body will not think you are starving and store fat.", "doctor_answer": "Try the rice diet. A cup of rice at meal times, and one piece of fruit (any kind) w/each meal.

{"question": "what is the best way to go through the grieving process of loosing a loved one?", "patient_answer": "It does take time to grieve, and it often takes much longer than people think. This is especially true if you witnessed the violent death of your fiance. \n\nOne of the ways that people grieve is to talk about the person they lost, the event if they witness it, and how their life is different since their loss. One of the problems is that people around you often feel that you should be over it by now, and they may not be as available to listen. So you might want to check out a community bereavement group that might allow you to talk with others over a period of a few months. For many people this helps them to process their loss.\n\nFor the record, I don't think you ever \"get over\" someone, but you are able to put the loss in perspective. I've heard people say that \"I haven't forgotten the person, but I can now think about them without crying!\"\n\nYour local hospice, hospital, mental health association or even a local funeral home may offer bereavement groups. Most of the time they are free of charge, as well.\n\nSince you did witness the violent death of your fiance, you might also have some issues related to that trauma itself. If you have other symptoms of anxiety or depression you might want to talk this over with your doctor or a mental health professional.", "doctor_answer": "Everybody goes through it differently, and it can take time.  You just don't get over someone you love who dies--suddenly or otherwise.  Plus, you say he was killed in front of you--that suggests it may have been violent.  Dealing with that aspect alone is a major undertaking.\n\nIf you haven't already, you really need to talk about it with someone--even if it's just your boyfriend.  If he cares for you, he'll at least be a sympathetic ear.  You should consider a professional, too--maybe just a clergyman you know.  They're all trained in some basic counseling skills.  To move on from someone's death means accepting it, and you may need some help with that."}

A nurse practitioner provides some care previously offered only by physicians and in most states has the ability to prescribe medications. Working in collaboration with a physician, a nurse practitioner provides high-quality, cost-effective and individualized care for the lifespan of patient's special needs. NPs focus largely on health maintenance, disease prevention, counseling and patient education in a wide variety of settings. With a strong emphasis on primary care, nurse practitioners are employed within several specialties, including neonatology, nurse-midwifery, pediatrics, school health, family and adult health, women's health, mental health, home care, geriatrics and acute care. \nNurse practitioners are educated through programs that grant either a certificate or a master's degree. A registered nurse is recommended to have extensive clinical experience before applying to a nurse practitioner program. An intensive preceptorship under the direct supervision of a physician or an experienced nurse practitioner, as well as instruction in nursing theory, are key components to most NP programs. physician assistants (PAs) are non-physicians licensed to practice medicine with a physician's supervision. This supervision, in most cases, need not be direct or on site and many PAs practice in remote or underserved areas in satellite clinics. PAs can treat patients and, in most states, prescribe medicine, and in some states in the US they carry a DEA number that gives them authority to prescribe controlled medications like narcotics. PAs in surgical practices also serve as first assists in surgery. PAs provide medical services that are reimbursed under Medicare and third party insurances. Physician assistants and Nurse Practitioners both provide similar services in most states, the major distinction being that nurse practitioners are registered nurses by trade. Both are also known as Advanced Practice Clinicians (APCs) or mid-level practitioners (MLPs)."}

{"question": "My normally calm life is unraveling and I am stressed to the max.   Any stress busters?  No drugs or alcohol!?", "patient_answer": "1) Stress & Tention Instant Breathing exercise.  Take a deep breath, then tense up your shoulders (tighen them and lift shoulders to ears;  really squeeze those shoulder muscles) count slowly to 5 (1 one-onethousand, two-onethousand. . .five-onethousand).  Slowly exhale.\n\nRepete 10 times. . . this takes 5-7 min.  \n\n2) Meditation & Yoga & Boxing are great when you can set up the time for these.  I find that when my life is unravalling, that I just can't make it to group exercise classes, so I have to do little exercises I've learned in the past classes for short intervals (say 5-10 minutes).\n\nHappy New Year, hope you get your peace back soon.", "doctor_answer": "I'll add dancing to these suggestions."}
{"question": "What can I use to remove a brown colored spot from my under arms caused by the burning of deodorant?", "patient_answer": "I ended up with lumps too...a bright red, lumpy rash to be exact.  Turns out I can't use Secret (which pretty much knocks out Suave too, since it's named to be Secret's imitaion).  I use Dove now and am fine.\n\nSwitch deodorants and be extra gentle to that area for the time being.  I know it will totally suck, but do not shave your armpits until the spot is healed.  Depending on the severity, you may want to see a doctor.  If it's a relatively small spot, you can probably get away with just applying an antibiotic cream (such as Neosporin) to it a few times a day.  Also, you shouldn't use deodorant on that spot either.", "doctor_answer": "Perhaps if it is \"burned\" you should let it heal naturely.  The outer layer of skin is constantly being shed.  Hide your armpits until healed.  Sensitive skin may be harmed by medications not prescribed by a doctor.  Of course change deodorants too.  See a doctor if it does not clear up soon."}

{"question": "why is my left eye twitching?", "patient_answer": "Most eye twitches come and go as a result of stress and fatigue.  The muscles in our eyelids are very small, but have a very fast action, since we blink over 20,000 times a day.  When we are under stress, fatigue, or poor health those small muscles will start to fire off, even when we don't need to blink.  Eye twitches often come and go, and some people get them more than others.  Eye twitches usually resolve themselves within 1-2 weeks, especially if you can de-stress your life.  The best way to make them go away is to take a vacation and ignore them!  They'll go away on their own.", "doctor_answer": "Maybe this site will help. If not, call and ask a doctor."}

{"question": "what are the symtoms of testicular cancer?", "patient_answer": "Testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers in young men between the ages of 15 and 35, but the disease also occurs in other age groups, so all men should be aware of its symptoms. While testicular cancer is common among young men, young men typically do not develop any kind of cancer, so overall, testicular cancer is a relatively rare disease. This form of cancer is almost always curable if it is found early. Most testicular cancers are found by men themselves, either as a painless lump, a hardening or change in size of the testicle, or pain in the testicle. Children born with an undescended testicle have an increased risk of getting testicular cancer, regardless of whether surgery is done to correct the problem. However, the surgery should still be done to preserve fertility. The theory is that the increased risk of testicular cancer is due to whatever caused the undescended testicle, not just by the fact that the testicle was undescended.", "doctor_answer": "Common symptoms include a swelling and/or lump in one or both of the testes, a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, and a dull feeling of pain in the region of the lower abdominal area, groin, or lower back. Pain in the testes or scrotum may or may not be present."}
{"question": "I have been told that when you have a cold, you should not drink milk.

You should drink clear liquids. Plenty of water, and plenty of rest."}

{"question": "What is multiple sclerosis?", "patient_answer": "Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). \nMultiple sclerosis (MS) usually affects woman more than men. The disorder most commonly begins between ages 20 and 40, but can strike at any age.\n\nThe exact cause is not known, but MS is believed to result from damage to the myelin sheath, the protective material which surrounds nerve cells. It is a progressive disease, meaning the damage gets worse over time. Inflammation destroys the myelin, leaving multiple areas of scar tissue (sclerosis). The inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system.\n\nThe inflammation causes nerve impulses to slow down or become blocked, leading to the symptoms of MS. Repeated episodes, or flare ups, of inflammation can occur along any area of the brain and spinal cord.\n\nSymptoms vary because the location and extent of each attack varies. Usually episodes that last days, weeks, or months alternate with times of reduced or no symptoms (remission).\n\nRecurrence (relapse) is common although non-stop progression without periods of remission may also occur.\n\nResearchers are not sure what triggers an attack. Patients with MS typically have a higher number of immune cells than a healthy person, which suggests that an immune response might play a role. The most common theories point to a virus or genetic defect, or a combination of both. There also appears to be a genetic link to the disease. MS is more likely to occur in northern Europe, the northern United States, southern Australia, and New Zealand than in other areas. Geographic studies indicate there may be an environmental factor involved.\n\nPeople with a family history of MS and those who live in a geographical area with a higher incidence rate for MS have a higher risk of the disease.\n\nCheck out this article with excellent illustrations:\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000737.htm", "doctor_answer": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the Central Nervous System (CNS) - that's the brain and spinal cord. Predominantly, it is a disease of the \"white matter\" tissue. The white matter is made up of nerve fibres which are responsible for transmitting communication signals both internally within the CNS and between the CNS and the nerves supplying rest of the body."}
{"question": "what is thephysiology of thirst?", "patient_answer": "Thirst and drinking function to maintain body water balance and are basic to survival. Thirst is often associated with a dry unpleasant-tasting mouth and the feeling of a need to obtain water; it can result from dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, pharmacologic agents, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids. Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid. Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers. Although nurses are commonly confronted with client complaints of thirst, there has been minimal nursing research that relates to assessment of thirst and drinking behaviors, nursing diagnoses for thirst, or nursing interventions for persons with altered thirst or drinking behaviors.\n\nThirst is the sensation indicating the body's need for water. Dry or salty food and dry, dusty air may induce such a sensation by depleting moisture in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Relief through ingestion of water is only temporary, however, if thirst results from a generalized depletion of water in the system. About three fourths of the body is composed of fluids, and the average adult requires 21/2 qt (2.4 liters) of fluid per day, supplied by water, other beverages, and foods. Depriving the body of water interferes with its metabolism and functions, causing dehydration, which is eventually fatal. The unnatural thirst that accompanies fever, diabetes, and other disorders is caused by a rapid reduction of the body fluids. The sensation of thirst is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus in the brain. Dehydration of the cells triggers the posterior pituitary to releast the antidiuretic hormone (ADH).", "doctor_answer": "To put it simply, you loose water, it concentrates your blood and your brain detects this concentration (osmolality) and sends a signal to drink and to also limit excretion of water.  Its caused by the salt concentration of our blood as sensed by the brain.  IF you are thirsty, you are 1% dehyradted."}

In order to get the disease, both parents have to be carriers of the disease."}
{"question": "Why do women who spend a lot of time together have their periods at the same time?", "patient_answer": "A: Women (and men) secrete odorless molecules, called pheromones, in a manner as common as sweating. In fact, the sweat of many mammals contains pheromone chemicals. The molecules from one woman bounce and jiggle their way airborne and waft to another. Receptors in the nose detect the pheromones and the second woman responds by shortening or lengthening her menstrual period. Gradually, over the course of a few months, the periods of all the women living together synchronize in this way.", "doctor_answer": "It's called synchronious menstruation.  It's happened to me on two occasions.  Once at a camp where there were about 30 girls in a cabin, and I swear to you, every single one of us got our periods over a period of 10 days.

There are currently 2.2 million people suffering from Schizophrenia in the US today.  Worldwide, the disease affects about 1% of the population.", "doctor_answer": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disease. Approximately 1 percent of the population develops schizophrenia during their lifetime – more than 2 million Americans suffer from the illness in a given year. Although schizophrenia affects men and women with equal frequency, the disorder often appears earlier in men, usually in the late teens or early twenties, than in women, who are generally affected in the twenties to early thirties. People with schizophrenia often suffer terrifying symptoms such as hearing internal voices not heard by others, or believing that other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts, or plotting to harm them. These symptoms may leave them fearful and withdrawn. Their speech and behavior can be so disorganized that they may be incomprehensible or frightening to others. Available treatments can relieve many symptoms, but most people with schizophrenia continue to suffer some symptoms throughout their lives; it has been estimated that no more than one in five individuals recovers completely. \n\nChildren with ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, and other emotional disturbances are often misdiagnosed as Schizophrenia."}

{"question": "how does injections of haldol or prolixin help treat bipolar disorder?", "patient_answer": "Haldol and prolixin are antipsychotic drugs, also formerly known as \"major tranquilizers\".

These drugs will calm any kind of agitation or excitement, such as the mania of a bipolar (manic depressive).  These drugs make you like a zombie.  You may still be awake, but your emotions are paralyzed.  There is no special effect on manic depressives. These drugs should not be used without strong reason to do so, as they can cause permanant neurological impairment, called Tardive Dyskinesia, where a person has involuntary movements usually of his mouth and face, even tounge.  Also, these drugs cause temporary Parkinson like effects, making the user stiff, and making it difficult to initiate movement like getting out of a chair as well as akathesia, where the patient is very restless and can't sit or lay still.", "doctor_answer": "Balances the chemicals in your brain-lifelong treatment"}

I recently started again a few years ago and have been off of it for a little over a year and my period still isn't regular. My OB/GYN said that it can take up to 2 years for your body to rid itself of the birth control (whether it be the pill or the shot) and go back to normal. Just be patient. It'll balance out eventually.", "doctor_answer": "Early menopause is often an over looked cause. Birth control pills, also causes frequent missed periods.\n\nNevertheless, you should contact a Physician/Gynecologist in your area in regards to this issue so that he/she can rule out the possibility of a tumor. Amenorrhea (Absence of Menstruation) is actually only a symptom resulting from a glandular malfunction, a chronic disease, a metabolic disorder such as diabetes, obesity, malnutrition, and tumors, or more importantly, a neurosis precipitated by emotional distress (unhappy love affair, divorce, and the like). However, hormonal treatment is most frequently employed when the possibility of tumor has been ruled out; while neurotic disorders may require psychiatric help, but even in this case, hormonal theraphy can be very helpful.\n\nAgain, much depends on the underlying trouble; some cases can be completly cured, for others medical help is limited.

{"question": "when the power of pregnancy of a mature female is most active?", "patient_answer": "I just answered another VERY similar question in the pregnancy section, so I'll just repost it here, verbatim.\n\nTaken from http://www.ovulation-calculator.com/conception.htm\n\nUnderstanding how the menstrual cycle functions - and what happens during ovulation - is key to the successful prediction of ovulation. But what happens exactly? Let's look at the dynamics of fertility and conception.\n\nDuring your menstrual cycle, there are far more infertile days than fertile days. The fertile days are days when there is a possibility for conceiving. However, within your fertile period - the window of opportunity for conception - there are days of \"peak fertility\". Identifying these peak times, and planning accordingly, can help maximize your chances of becoming pregnant.\n\nThe Dynamics of Fertility\nA woman's fertile period during her menstrual cycle, on average, lasts about 9 days. The most fertile period consists of the few days before ovulation. There are a number of reasons why this is the most fertile time. First of all, the amount of cervical fluid increases - and the consistency of the mucus changes substantially (from being sticky and cloudy to becoming transparent, white, and slippery). The purpose of this change is to create a healthy medium for the sperm to survive and travel in. Given a fertile environment, sperm can live several days. The egg, on the other hand, can live only 24 hours - so timing is important. At the moment of ovulation, the body temperature begins to rise to create a warmer, more hospitable environment for a fertilized egg. Also, the cervix will start to rise, soften, and begin to open up.\n\nHormones and Ovulation: The Release of the Egg\nDuring ovulation, a number of different hormonal changes take place. Early in the menstrual cycle, a hormone called Follicle Stimulating Hormone - or FSH - enables your ovaries to nurture eggs. Within the ovaries, follicles house each individual developing egg. The follicles that hold the eggs will secrete estrogen. As the menstrual cycle progresses, the follicle containing the developing egg moves toward the surface of the ovary. Immediately before ovulation, the follicle begins secreting estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen helps the uterine lining thicken and expand, and increases blood flow to the uterus. Progesterone causes the glands of the uterine lining to form secretions that help nourish a fertilized egg.\n\nOvulation\nBy definition, ovulation is the process of an ovary releasing an egg from the follicle - permitting the egg to float down the fallopian tubes. On average, the first phase of the menstrual cycle last two weeks. Directly prior to ovulation, another hormonal change takes place - the LH Surge. LH (or Luteinizing Hormone) is the hormone that actually facilitates ovulation: it causes the egg to separate from the ovarian surface. Ovulation predictor tests function by detecting this LH Surge, thus alerting the woman that ovulation is about to take place.\n\nOnce released from the ovaries (post-ovulation), the egg can survive for about 24 hours. This means that sperm (which can live several days) must be present to fertilize the egg. Following ovulation, the egg enters the fallopian tubes and continues toward the womb. Typically, conception - the uniting of the egg and the sperm - will take place in the fallopian tube, and then the fertilized egg will continue its passage to the uterus and implant in the uterine wall. For pregnancy to take place, fertilization of the egg must be followed by a successful implantation.\n\nFollowing ovulation, the luteal phase begins, marked by an increase of the hormone progesterone, which strengthens the uterine lining (endometrium) and causes the body temperature to increase, facilitates changes in the cervical fluid, and alters the position of the cervix.\n\nWithin 24 hours, if the egg has not been fertilized, it will simply disintegrate after reaching the uterus. Without fertilization - and i", "doctor_answer": "Let's vote!"}

{"question": "What does the medical term \"code black\" mean?", "patient_answer": "It means \"bomb threat\".  Owch!", "doctor_answer": "I have worked as a nurse in hospitals since June of 2001.  Never ran across a code black.  Code red was a fire.  Code blue, pt. not breathing.  Code yellow, community disaster.  Code pink, missing or stolen baby.  Code green, all clear.  We did not have a code for bomb threat since that would be possibly announcing to the threatening individual that his message was out.  It was handled over the phone and *silently* communicated to those around us so that 911 could be called to tap the line, etc.  \nBut then again, I have not worked in every hospital.  Maybe somewhere else uses a code black."}
{"question": "What is the normal TSH range for thyroid function?", "patient_answer": "The normal TSH range is .200-5.5 (a high number is overactive; a low number is underactive)", "doctor_answer": "TSH is Thyroid Stimulating Hormone.  It is secreted through a feedback system in your body that looks at the amount of T3 and T4 hormones (the ones that are secreted by the thyroid gland) is circulating in your system. \n\nThe range for a normal thyroid has varied over time.  Contrary to what the previous responder said, 0.2 is the right TSH measurement for a normally functioning thyroid.\n\nThe high end, which indicates a low-thyroid (hypothyroid) function has varied from 4 to 5.5 over the many years I have had mine measured.  5.5 is very high and indicative of a low  metabolism.  Many of the experts I have read say it should be below 2.\n\nWe live in an iodine deficient country.  The iodine in the soil between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalacians was depleted with the last ice age.  In the early 1900s there were such outbreaks of goiter, that the area was nicknamed the \"goiter belt\" and iodine was added to our salt.  It was also used as a conditioner in bread and in the red food dye that was used in hot dogs.  Since then they have lowered the amount in salt and done away with the other uses.\n\nI use a relatively high dosage potassium-iodine supplement (similar in amount to that which the Japanese ingest daily with their diet) and have seen great improvements with my thyroid and with my metabolism."}
{"question": "I need to know about cnv in new borns.What is it? What caused it?", "patient_answer": "Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is normally associated with macular degeneration. Most of the time, this occurs when new blood vessels grow through cracks in tissue layers beneath the retina called Bruch's membrane. As CNV progresses, the abnormal vessels may leak fluid and bleed.  Eventually this process causes damage to the overlying retina. Decreased and/or distorted vision will often occur. As for the cause in a newborn, I would guess that it would be an inherited eye disease.", "doctor_answer": "I think that you mean CMV, cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus related to the herpes virus group of infections. Like herpes, it is inactive at times, but it is incurable and is a life-time infection. CMV may be passed from a mother to her baby during pregnancy and is the most common congenital viral infection. It is also called congenital cytomegalovirus or cytomegalovirus inclusion disease. CMV without symptoms is common in babies and young children. It is found in saliva, urine, semen, and other body fluids. The virus is easily spread in households and in daycare centers. It can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy and to the baby during delivery or in breast milk.\n\nOver half of women of childbearing age become infected with CMV at least six months before becoming pregnant. There appear to be few risks for complications of CMV for this group and only a few babies have the infection at birth. These babies appear to have no significant illness or abnormalities.\n\nAbout 90 percent of babies who are infected with CMV have no symptoms at birth. But as many as 15 percent of these babies develop one or more neurological abnormalities — such as mental retardation, learning disabilities, hearing or vision loss — usually in the first year or two of life. Congenital CMV infection is a leading cause of hearing loss in children.\n\nAbout one in 1,000 babies (about 4,000 babies each year) shows symptoms of CMV at birth. These symptoms may include an enlarged spleen or liver, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and a distinctive rash. Up to 20 percent of these babies die, and about 90 percent of the survivors suffer from serious neurological defects, such as mental retardation.\n\nAt present there is no treatment that can halt or reverse the effects of congenital CMV. However, doctors are investigating whether a new antiviral drug called ganciclovir — which is used to treat adults with AIDS who have CMV-related eye infections — also may help babies with congenital CMV."}

{"question": "What  are the symptoms Fetal Alcohol Syndrome?", "patient_answer": "Mental retardation is the most common and serious birth defect associated with FAS.  Perhaps the most notable defects in FAS involve the face and eyes. In general, these defects are obvious and include facial bone hypoplasia (under-development), a long, underdeveloped philtrum (the groove in the middle of the upper lip), a thin upper lip, a short nose, and ptosis (drooping of the eyelids). Although the typical facial features may not be as apparent during the newborn period, they become more prominent as the infant develops. As these children grow into young adulthood, however, the facial abnormalities become more subtle and thereby contribute to the difficulty of recognizing FAS in older persons. With these physical abnormalities come sensory deficits that frequently involve vision, hearing and speech. Hyperacusis (abnormal acuteness of hearing) is common in infants, and approximately one third of these infants have a conductive hearing loss and another one-third have a sensorineural hearing loss.

Only people with intimate contact with birds, in Asia the poor live with chickens in their houses, have gotten it. It is very difficult to spread through the air and it doesn't pass from human to human. The reason why it is so 'news worthy' is that it is a brand new strain no one in history has been exposed to and therefore no one has a natural immunity/resistance to, once you get it your immune system doesn't recognize it and put up a fight.\n\nDon't worry about getting a flu shot. While you can't get the flu from a flu shot (a common myth), it won't protect you. The World Health Organization predicts the 3 most common strains every year and combines them in a single shot.

Addiction is defined as the compulsive need for and use of something that is psychologically or physically habit-forming, characterized by tolerance and by well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal; Being abnormally tolerant to and dependent upon a habit forming substance (such as the endorphins caused by throwing up, or the habit forming behavior of bingeing and the fear of gaining weight that leads to purging/laxatives/exercise in bulimia).\n\nWhat matters most is whether or not the substance or behavior causes what we now know to be the essence of addiction: uncontrollable, compulsive drug craving, seeking, and use, even in the face of negative health and social consequences.\n\nAddicts are trapped in their behaviors and cannot simply quit on their own. They have an illness that requires biomedical treatment. People often assume that because addiction begins with a voluntary behavior and is expressed in the form of excess behavior, an addict should just be able to quit by force of will alone. However, it is essential to understand when dealing with addicts that we are dealing with individuals whose brains have been altered by alcohol, drug or behavioral abuse. They need addiction treatment.\n\nToday, scientists and physicians overwhelmingly agree that while use and even abuse of drugs such as alcohol and cocaine is a behavior over which the individual exerts control, addiction to these substances is something different. Scientists have begun to understand why addicted people may sacrifice everything that's important to them -- their jobs, their families, their homes -- in the quest for a fix.\n\nBest,\n\n`k.", "doctor_answer": "I happen to agree with your friend. I've had my share of both bulimia and other addictions, and I classify all of them as \"coping mechanisms\" and \"distraction tools\".

My body wouldn't be as used to the other machines - they'd work out different muscles so I wouldn't have to push myself as hard and would get more benefit.\n\n- Re-examine the reasons why you want to lose weight. Cut out some pictures from magazines of how you'd like to look, and also break out pictures of how you looked before your weightloss, and stick them on the fridge and food cabinets.

(around the house probably is best ;-) ). It'll make you think about your stomach more and motivate you to eat less and work out more. \n\n- Limit the amount of times you eat out per week, or if you eat out, have them bring out a take-home box when they bring out your food so you can spoon out half to take home right away so it's not sitting there on your plate tempting you while you eat.", "doctor_answer": "Reduce food intake and increase exercise.

{"question": "why do i have headaches everyday?", "patient_answer": "If your Doctor said that it is not migrains then it is probably tension headaches.  This is cause by contraction of some of the back muscles related to stress such as Trapezius, semispinalis capitits, splenious capitis etc.. Basically this tension that most probably is triggered by some sort of stress puts pressure on a spinal nerve coming out of the spinal cord that inhibits the optimum potential of your body to function properly.. Chiropractic uses a non invasive procedure to remove that nerve interference and permit the body to function in harmony without obstruction.. Chiropractic is proven and documented by peer reviewed journals to be effective with patients that have headaches.. What you don't want to do is rely on medication because your body will adapt to the chemicals and you'll always have to take them to feel normal.. Don't forget about the side effects that all medications have especially to the liver!!!! Get your spine checked and the headaches will go away..", "doctor_answer": "Because alll girls are always in pain.   I learned this when i began dating.

If it is a green or bluish tint then that means there's too much uric acid that could crystalize into a stone.  The predominance of uric acid can also be caused by the liver.  If you have mono (mono stays in the body for 7 years) then that could cause the discoloration.  Also if you eat or drink things with a lot of blue or green pigment added.\n   If your urine is the color of apple-juice or has a lot of red, then there could be blood and that could indicat a stone or an infection.\n   The kidneys are located in the mid back under the rib-cage.

{"question": "have you heard of schlerdoma? (spell check)?", "patient_answer": "From emedicine:  Scleroderma is a systemic disease that affects many organ systems. It is most obvious in the skin; however, the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory, renal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems, as well as numerous vascular structures, are involved frequently. The symptoms result from progressive tissue fibrosis and occlusion of the microvasculature by excessive production and deposition of types I and III collagens. Other macromolecules found in the connective tissue (eg, glycosaminoglycans, tenascin, fibronectin) also are increased. The vascular alterations show a predilection for affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. The small vessel cytoskeleton is affected by structural defects that lead to collapse. Next, the tight junctions become altered and are no longer functional, allowing the endothelium to slip into the vessel lumen.\n\nFrom webmd:  Scleroderma (pronounced SKLEER-oh-der-ma) is Greek for hard skin. It's classified as both a connective-tissue disorder and a rheumatic condition. In scleroderma, the skin gradually tightens and thickens or hardens. It loses its ability to stretch. Tiny blood vessels throughout the body also may be affected, causing widespread damage to the internal organs.", "doctor_answer": "yes.\nscleroderma.\nwhy?"}
{"question": "How would you know the difference between Pagets breast cancer & eczema?", "patient_answer": "Go see a good oncological surgeon or skin doctor and have that looked at. While this implies it is not Pagets since you state that it is above the nipple. \n\nHowever be safe for see a doctor and get it checked. This is not something to wait on. \n\n\nPAGET'S DISEASE:\n\nIntroduction:\nPaget's disease of the breast is a rare form of breast cancer in which the first clinical finding is usually scaling of the nipple skin. It may also be associated with nipple redness and burning. The diagnosis of this condition is typically made with a skin biopsy, which shows cells typical of this condition (Paget's cells). The \"good news\" about Paget's disease is that it is usually a \"curable cancer\". However, most cases of scaling and burning of the nipple are due to benign conditions which can be easily confused with Paget's disease.\n\nMaking the Diagnosis:\nThe major goal of this section is to help women (and their physicians) detect the early nipple changes associated with Paget's disease, and to help differentiate them from benign conditions. Making the diagnosis of Paget's disease is actually quite easy. We use a simple skin punch biopsy technique to remove a small piece of tissue from the area of the nipple with the abnormal changes. This procedure takes a few minutes to perform under local anesthesia and is painless. A small amount of skin and underlying tissues is removed and sent to the pathologist. In our experience with hundreds of cases it has proven to be 100% accurate. \n\nThe first step in evaluating any patient with a change in the skin of the nipple is to obtain a careful history and to perform a careful breast examination, followed by a diagnostic mammogram. When performing a diagnostic mammogram the mammographer is informed about the posibility Paget's disease. Special films look for fine calcifications behind the nipple. If the mammogram is negative and our clinical suspicion is low, we usually suggest that the patient place a cortisone cream on the nipple for two weeks. \n\nIf the condition has not responded completely to treatment in two weeks, we proceed to a skin punch biopsy. (a word of caution: we have seen cases of Paget's disease in which the mammogram was negative. The patient seemed to respond to treatment, but nipple changes recurred again in a few months. Therefore if a biopsy is not done, careful follow-up is recommended). Our rule of thumb: if in doubt, do a skin biopsy.", "doctor_answer": "Sometimes you can't just by examining it. Have adermatologist take a biopsy. That way you'll know for sure."}

{"question": "Is there a home remedy to detox from nicotine ?", "patient_answer": "I found this - I hope it helps!\n\nThe Recovery Process\n\nSuccessful nicotine dependency recovery is in maintaining the motivations, dreams and patience needed to allow: (1) the physical mind time to re-sensitize itself and re-adjust to functioning normally again; (2) the subconscious mind time to encounter and re-condition the bulk of its nicotine feeding cues that triggered brief anxiety episodes in an attempt to gain compliance; and (3) the conscious mind time to either allow years of defensive dependency rationalizations to fade into distant memory, or the intelligent quitter time to more rapidly destroy their impact through honest reflection. \n\nThe ex-smoker will find themselves enjoying a deep and rich sense of inner quiet, calmness, and tranquility once their temporary journey of re-adjustment is substantially complete. \n\nThe body's nicotine reserves decline by about half every two hours. It's not only the basic chemical half-life clock which determines mandatory nicotine feeding times, when quitting it's also the clock that determines how long it takes before the brain begins bathing in nicotine free blood-serum, the moment that real healing begins. \n\nIt can take up to 72 hours for the blood-serum to become nicotine-free and 90% of nicotine's metabolites to exit the body via your urine. It's then that the anxieties associated with readjustment normally peak in intensity and begin to gradually decline. \n\nBut just one powerful \"hit\" of nicotine and you’ll again face another 72 hours of detox anxieties. It's why the one puff survival rate is almost zero. None of us are stronger than nicotine but then we don’t need to be as it is simply a chemical with an I.Q. of zero. It does not plot, plan or conspire and is not some demon within us. Our most effective weapon against it is, and always has been, our vastly superior intelligence but only if put to work. \n\nNicotine Replacement Products\n\nThe key to nicotine dependency recovery is not in dragging out the 72 hours of detox by toying for weeks or months with gradual nicotine weaning or other creative means for delivering nicotine. The nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) industry want smokers to believe that a natural poison is medicine, that its use is therapy, and that it is somehow different from the tobacco plant's nicotine molecule. The truth is that the pharmaceutical industry buys its nicotiana from the exact same growers as the tobacco industry. They want you to believe that double-blind placebo controlled studies proved that NRT doubles a cold turkey quitters odds of quitting and that only superheros can quit without it. The truth is that their studies were not blind as claimed, and that all but a tiny sliver of earth's successful quitters are quitting entirely on their own. Here are a few facts that those selling creative nicotine delivery devices would rather you not know: \n\nNicotine is a psychoactive drug whose \"high\" provides a dopamine \"aaahhh\" sensation and an adrenaline rush. Would you have been able to tell, within 5 minutes, whether the gum or lozenge you'd been given contained the nicotine equilivent of smoking two cigarettes or was instead a nicotine-free placebo? So could they. A 2004 study found that NRT studies suffered from massive wide-spread blinding failures (May 2004) \nA nicotine smoker's natural odds of quitting for six months, entirely on their own, without any products, procedures, education programs, counseling or formal support is roughly 10% (June 2000) \nThose using the over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine patch or gum as a stand-alone quitting tool have only a 7% chance of quitting smoking for six months (March 2003) \nUp to 7% of OTC nicotine gum quitters are still chronic users of nicotine gum at six months (May 2004). Question: isn't 7 minus 7 still zero? (May 2004) \n36.6% of all current nicotine gum users are chronic long-term users (May 2004) \nYou tr", "doctor_answer": "Short answer?\n1. Stay off nicotine - there are plenty of methods to stop the addiction, but pick one.\n2. Fill your system with good stuff: clear air and healthy food. Do this by taking deep breaths and exhaling completely, and eating only healthy foods (including snacks) for at least a week.\n3.

{"question": "how do i treat a runny nose and non stop caugh?", "patient_answer": "An ANTIHISTAMINE stops a runny nose.\n(You may also want a DECONGESTANT, which clears a stuffy nose.)\n\nA COUGH SUPPRESSANT stops coughs.\n(You may also want an EXPECTORANT, which thins out the mucus so that your lungs can more easily expel it.)\n\nNyquil has both an antihistamine and a cough suppressant.  I highly recommend it.\nIt used to have a decongestant, but the new formula no longer does.  Sudafed is a good decongestant that you can buy separately.", "doctor_answer": "There is no cure for the common cold, but you can get relief from your cold symptoms by:\n \n*Resting in bed \n*Drinking plenty of fluids \n*Gargling with warm salt water or using throat *sprays or lozenges for a scratchy or sore throat \n*Using petroleum jelly for a raw nose \n*Taking aspirin or acetaminophen, Tylenol, for example, for headache or fever \n\n** I am going to add here that you can take decongestants such as Robitussin DM that will manage both the cough and the runny nose.

Run it under cold water for a really long time until it doesn't hurt anymore.\n\nThere's also a product called \"Burn Free\" that will take the heat out immediately after it's burned.\n\nAfter the heat is totally gone, Bag Balm can help the burn to heal faster.  Don't put Bag Balm on the burn until the heat is all gone because it could actually seal the heat in and cause it to burn more.  Diaper rash cream like Desitin should also help it to heal faster."}

{"question": "What's the best remedy for arthritic hands?", "patient_answer": "Well, it's basically an inflammation.  Anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen can be an enormous help.  Unfortunately, oral administration distributes the drug to the whole body, and the place where you need it can be under-treated.  Plus, ibuprofen and aspirin can cause stomach problems if you start raising the dosage.  \n\nThere is a solution- topical administration.  Ask your doctor for a prescription for ibuprofen cream.  It is usually called something else, like ketoprofen, and can be made with a topical pain-reliever such as bupivicane (like lidocaine).  Keep in mind your doctor may not have heard of it, and that it has to be compounded.  Check your phonebook for local compounding pharmacies so that you can give your doctor their phone number. Typically the cream comes as 10-20% active, which is possible because it will never be in your stomach to cause problems.  Unfortunately, because it has to be compounded, your insurance company will probably not cover it in the same way as regular drugs.  You may be looking at paying $50 for a 4oz jar. \n\nWhen you apply- be sure to really rub and massage the cream into your hands hard for 5-10 minutes.  This will help just as much as the ibuprofen will, because the muscle work will greatly increase blood flow to the area.  Together, massage and anti-inflammatory therapy can provide great relief.\n\nResults vary with patient.  I hope you find it useful.", "doctor_answer": "i have always wore a metal bracelette around mine and it always works for me"}

Try a humidifier - I didn't used to like them, but there are many kinds to choose from now. Next, try the shorter, less frequent, less hot showers, using Dove creamy sensitive skin body wash, followed by Lubriderm sensitive skin lotion applied within 3 minutes of showering. Bag/udder balm also works for a lot of people... but even that may mean trying different brands. \n\nI had tried just about everything, and finally went to a dermatologist.

{"question": "why do i have backache?", "patient_answer": "Well, there are any number of reasons you have a backache, and likewise, any number of remedies. The biggest reason is generally muscle strain. \n\nSince it's a strain, you can generally handle it much like any other strain (apply gentle warmth to the area to encourage blood flow and reduce activity that cause the problem). I've also found that taking    acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps me more than an asperin does, but that's just me. \n\nObviously you should also consider avoiding whatever activity causes these backaches. Make sure you wear flat shoes with proper arch support, sit with your back flush against the back of the chair, lift with your legs, etc. \n\nIf you're experiencing frequent backaches, or particularly severe ones, naturally, go see your doctor. Actually, seeing a doctor probably isn't that bad an idea since they'll be able to help identify causes and activities that may help reduce the problem.", "doctor_answer": "You could have strained your back lifting, in which rest and advil will fix you up in no time. Or it could just be from muscle fatigue from excercise - again, rest and advil. Or it could also be kidney failure, in which case the remedy would be more extreme."}

I've been trying to convince her that filling her life with more waste of space guys are not the way to being less lonely, especially since the guys she's attracted to have no life. I'll tell you what I told her. Finish high school. Then take some college courses. Get a job. In between times, surround yourself with a healthy circle of friends...ones that aren't after you for money, a place to sleep, or smokes. Find other young mom's who are doing the same thing. Find a MOPS group...Mother's Of Pre-schoolers. It's a mother's group, who meet regularly (weekly) and get together with their children, sharing tips, recipes, cleaning ideas, and each others problems. Once a month, they hire a babysitter and do something together, like go to a movie, bowling or a number of other fun, wholesome activities. Getting involved with a volunteer organization will get you out of the house and helping others with bigger needs than yours. If your child is old enough (as young as 3), you can enroll them in Headstart. There are lots of activities for the parent to get involved with there, along with being with other parents who are going through some of the same things. Some people will find an grandmother-type person, who is still very active, and you help each other. She can help you with your child, being a surrogate grandma, and she can teach you what she knows. You can help her with some of the chores that are maybe a little difficult for her. The thing is to do something with your life that's meaningful to you and your child. When you get involved, you teach yourself and you teach your child, and you'll end up showing your child how to give of himself to those less fortunate. <*)))><", "doctor_answer": "Geez I would say listen to starshadow and not the guy who accused you of being selfish.

{"question": "Running a fever - 102.0, to be exact.?", "patient_answer": "Watch for early signs of dehydration and drink extra fluids, especially water. Adults should drink at least 10 glasses of liquid a day to replenish lost fluids. Children between the ages of 4 and 10 should drink at least 6 to 10 glasses.

Many people find that taking a lukewarm [80° (26.7°) to 90° (32.2°)] shower or bath makes them feel better when they have a fever. Do not try to take a shower if you are dizzy or unsteady on your feet. Increase the water temperature if you start to shiver. Shivering is a sign that your body is trying to raise its temperature. Do not use rubbing alcohol, ice, or cold water to cool your body. Dress lightly when you have a fever. This will help your body cool down. Wear light pajamas or a light undershirt. Do not wear very warm clothing or use heavy bed covers. Keep room temperature at 70° (21.1°) or lower.

I remember when the Atkins diet was all the rage and everyone that couldn't loose weight wanted to try it. It did help some people, but I wasn't able to do the diet because of the kidney problem I have. The diet puts too much protein in your blood. You have to use good judgment when trying new things. A good rule of thumb: always check things out and find out what your alternatives are.", "doctor_answer": "Whether or not it is good for you will depend on how you implement it.  \n\nThe problem is that some of what he says (depending on which version you have) is amazingly wrong and can lead you to very unhealthy behaviors - such as \"Bacon won't hurt you!\" and \"Fried Pork Rinds are a great way to lose weight\"\n\nRight.

There really is no way for people, by themselves, to improve their eyesight.  That is why we have glasses and contact lenses.  If you just don't want to wear glasses, you could talk to your optometrist or ophthalmologist about the possibility of wearing contact lenses or undergoing LASIK surgery.  Not everyone is a suitable candidate for LASIK and not everyone can wear contact lenses, so be sure to ask your eye care provider."}
{"question": "Are teeth capable of replacing worn enamel?", "patient_answer": "No. Our teeth (I'm referring to humans) are brachydont; that is, they only grow for a limited period and afterwards the roots of the tooth become closed. This means that there will be no new materials added, and they will become more and more worn. However, enamel is the hardest tissue in our entire bodies, so normally it doesn't wear off completely during a lifetime.\nOther mammals have ever-growing teeth; in that case both enamel and dentine are replaced constantly.\n_________________\nStreamcat, I hope you're joking. And I thought the question referred to a natural process. Of course dentists can replace enamel with synthetic materials.\n-----------------\nCan certain animals grow new enamel? Yes, but not in the sense of \"repairing\" their teeth. It's more simple than that: the distal part of the tooth (the functional end) is continually being worn, and the new tissues arise from the basal parts. Those are hypsodont teeth (as rodent incisors and the molars of many herbivores). If you get the chance to examine a rodent skull, you'll see that their incisors don't really have roots, they look like long curved cylinders with an open base.", "doctor_answer": "How do those animals do that? If we are smarter than animals should'nt we be able to figure out how to do that? The apical foramen may be small, but its not closed. Fillings are just a patch, I would'nt consider them to replace enamel."}

{"question": "what is the best cure for pubic lice?", "patient_answer": "Shave it off.", "doctor_answer": "Shaving the hair is unnecessary. Recommended treatment regimens are either a 1 percent lindane shampoo applied for four minutes and then washed off, a 1 percent lindane lotion applied for 2 hours and then washed off, or a 1 percent permethrin cream rinse (Nix) which is washed off after 10 minutes. Lindane requires a prescription. It should not be used by people with extreme dermatitis because it could cause seizures. Also, lindane resistance has been reported in parts of the United States. You can buy other pesticide treatments, containing pyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide (A-200, Rid), without a prescription. They are applied for 10 minutes and then washed off. If you are allergic to ragweed, you should avoid these products. There are also products for inanimate objects such as furniture. These should not be used on humans or animals. If you have lice clinging to your eyelashes, do not use any of these pesticide treatments to get rid of them. Instead, put some Vaseline on the edges of your lids twice a day for 10 days, which will smother the lice. You can also pluck them and the nits off with tweezers."}

{"question": "is ther any asbestos in cement?", "patient_answer": "No", "doctor_answer": "Asbestos fibers were a common ingredient in cement in the early 20th century - it made strong and durable building materials.  After the EPA banned asbestos in '73, I don't believe it was used anymore in production of cement building materials.  There are still building products in use today that were made when it was \"okay\" to build with it.  The asbestos in cement is non-friable, so the hazardous potential is extremely low.  Careful actions are taken when the older, asbestos-containing building materials have to be repaired.  However, after severe deterioration of the product, it can then be considered a hazardous material."}

{"question": "what is orgasm?", "patient_answer": "An orgasm, also known as a sexual climax, is a pleasurable physical, psychological or emotional response to prolonged sexual stimulation. It is often accompanied by a notable physiological reaction, such as ejaculation, blushing or spasm and may be followed by aftershocks.\n\nDictionaries still give the subsidiary meaning, \"a similar point of intensity of emotional excitement,\" but as of 2005 this usage has become obscure. It can be startling to modern readers when encountered in older literature.\n\n\nGeneral\nBoth males and females can experience orgasm, but the exact response varies across gender. Generally speaking, orgasm is the third stage of four in the human sexual response cycle, which is the currently accepted model of the physiological process of sexual stimulation", "doctor_answer": "You asked two questions that you might think are the same; but they are not. Orgasm is an experience resulting from the combined effects of physical stimulation, emotional bonding, intellectual intimacy and total surrender or giving to the experience of the moment that crest or climax in overwhelming sensual and spiritual thunderclaps.\n\nMany concepts may play a role in building orgasm, including thinking about making a baby, dominance and submission, etc.\n\nTrue love might be a component of a good orgasm, but is itself different and in the long term more fundamental than the orgasm. Having orgasms with someone you love is wonderful, but the existence of the orgasms does not in and of itself serve to indicate whether the relationship will endure over a long term."}

{"question": "what's bird flu?", "patient_answer": "Avian influenza (also known as bird flu, avian flu, influenzavirus A flu, type A flu, or genus A flu) is a flu due to a type of influenza virus that is hosted by birds, but may infect several species of mammals. It was first identified in Serbia Montenegro in the early 1900s and is now known to exist worldwide. A strain of the H5N1-type of avian influenzavirus that emerged in 1997 has been identified as the most likely source of a future influenza pandemic and is known to have infected 133 people in Asia since late 2003, killing 68.[1]\n\nThe avian influenza subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human deaths, are: H1N1 caused Spanish flu, H2N2 caused Asian Flu, H3N2 caused Hong Kong Flu, H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, H7N2, H7N3.", "doctor_answer": "Bird Flu \nHundreds of thousands of birds in Asia died due to a virus that has been dubbed the \"bird flu.\" The highly contagious illness is responsible for wiping out large numbers of poultry in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. The particular strain of influenza which has been reported as causing the deaths is called H5N1. Humans can contract the disease through close contact with infected birds, or with the feces of infected birds. It is not known to spread through human-to-human contact. There has been no indication that humans would get the disease through eating eggs or meat of sick birds.\n\nThe only known way to eradicate the disease is by culling infected flocks. Thus far millions of chickens, ducks and other kinds of poultry have been culled in an effort to eliminate the virus. There have been several deaths due to the flu and the World Health Organization has expressed concern that the virus could latch on to a human influenza virus, potentially causing a serious epidemic. The bird flu's symptoms in humans include fever and coughing and eventual pneumonia."}
{"question": "what does it mean if ur poop has blood in it?", "patient_answer": "I think it means you need to see a health care physician. Now for real... my exfather in law had this problem and seen a doctor and come to find out he had a hernia.", "doctor_answer": "Rectal bleeding has many causes including hemorrhoids, Crohn's Disease, fissures, peptic ulcer disease, polyps, amongst other reasons. Most rectal bleeding comes from the colon, rec-tum, or an-us. The color of the blood often depends on the location of the bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. The closer the bleeding site is to the an-us, the blood will be a brighter red. Bleeding from the transverse colon and the right colon tend to be dark red or maroon colored.

{"question": "Is there a life insurance for people with cancer.?", "patient_answer": "Depends on the type of cancer and how far along the treatments are.  The best bet is to contact a local life agent and give them all the information. Don't try to hide anything because it could result in a denial of payout down the road.  A local agent can talk with their underwriter to determine if they can write the policy and at what health class.", "doctor_answer": "Buy term life insurance.  Its relatively cheap, like 25 buxx a month depending on age.  Go and get about 4 or 5 different policies if you think this person is going to die.  Because they pay really low.  Like 20 grand if the person dies.  But, if they die in less then 2 years,  I think its only like 2000 plus how much you paid per month for every month that you paid.  So, if you paid 25 a month for 6 months, and the person dies, they give you only 2000 plus 150.  But if you can buy 4 or 5 of these, you can find 10 grand to bury this person.  These are the only insurance companies that will sell to you because they dont have to pay back anything to you.  If you cancel with no death, they owe you nothing."}

{"question": "if i am breastfeeding, what should i do to lose weight?", "patient_answer": "The wonderful thing about breastfeeding is that it burns an extra 300-500 calories a day! I was back down to 125lbs at 4 months after my baby was born and he was exclusively breastfed. You are able to do any exercise that is comfortable for your postpartum body. The only thing that is probably not okay are weight loss pills or supplements as they could pass through your milk to the baby; I would recommend checking them with a lactation consultant before using them.", "doctor_answer": "While breastfeeding, losing weight CAN be more difficult.  Most women find that they do not lose all of their \"baby\" weight until they wean (unless, like me, you had plenty of extra weight before the baby, and your body isn't all that concerned about if that pound is a \"baby\" pound or a \"too many chocolate donuts\" pound!).  However, weight loss during breastfeeding is possible (living proof!).  The best way to go is to reduce the number of calories you eat and increase your exercise (I know, it's not as fun as taking a diet pill, but it lasts longer!).  While breastfeeding, your body uses about 500 calories a day to make milk for baby.  The most important thing for you is to make sure the foods you are eating are 80-90 % healthy (like during pregnancy).  If you eat junk, your baby will still get good milk, but your body will suffer because you will not get the vitamens and minerals you need.  As far as exercise goes, if you haven't been exercising, start slowly.  And remember, it took 9 months to put the weight on -- it will likely take 9 months to take it off."}

{"question": "what is aortic valve replacement?", "patient_answer": "it replaces one of the valves in your heart (which function to move the blood to the rest of the body from the heart) to improve blood flow.", "doctor_answer": "The aortic valve is the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta.  This is where fresh oxygenated blood is pumped out to the entire body.  There are a variety of diseases that can require replacement of this valve, including aortic stenosis where the valve does not properly open and close, or an aortic insufficiency where the valve allows backflow of blood from the aorta back into the left ventricle of the heart.\n\nThere are two major types of aortic valve replacements - mechanical valves and biologic/tissue valves.  Mechanical valves have been around longer and subsequently have a very refined safety and efficacy profile.  The downside is that after the procedure, the patient must be put on blood thinners for the rest of their life.  Biologic/tissue valves do not need subsequent blood thinner treatment and therefore may benefit younger, generally healthy patients.  However, it has been shown that the durability of tissue valves may be lower than mechanical valves, which may require a repeat operation later in life.\n\nThere is a variation to the above procedures called the Ross procedure.  This procedure replaces the faulty aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve.  The pulmonary valve is then replaced with a tissue valve.  The rationale for doing this is that more strain is put on the aortic valve and therefore having the person's own anatomy in that place is preferable to having a weaker mechanical or tissue valve.  The pulmonary valve, which only pumps to the lungs (and therefore doesn't have to pump as hard) can withstand having a tissue valve, which isn't as durable.  In addition, this approach does not require blood thinners after the operation.\n\nCurrent cardiac surgery research is trying to investigate if valve replacement can be done in a minimally invasive way using catheter devices."}
{"question": "how can you releive sciatic pain?", "patient_answer": "Manual treatments for sciatica, including physical therapy and specific stretching and strengthening exercises, and manual manipulation (e.g. osteopathic or chiropractic manipulation) to help relieve the pressure on the nerve root, which is the cause of the pain. Medical treatments for sciatica, including medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral steroids, or epidural steroid injections to help relieve the inflammation, which is usually a component of the pain. Surgery for sciatica, such as microdiscectomy or lumbar laminectomy and discectomy, to remove the portion of the disc that is irritating the nerve root. This surgery is designed to help relieve both the pressure and inflammation and may be warranted if the sciatic nerve pain is severe and has not been relieved with appropriate manual or medical treatments.", "doctor_answer": "Surgery and meds are the last option IMO! \n\nThe first thing to do is determine the cause and to see if it is true sciatica. Try seeing a Chiropractor. They are excellent at analyzing xrays and will be able to determine why the sciatica is happening and will either refer out or provide treatment. Massage is also great for sciatica & a well trained massage therapist will be able to give you therapeutic exercises to help manage the pain. \n\nThe chiropractor & massage therapist will also be able to give you pointers on lifestyle changes...for sleeping postion, footwear, posture, etc."}
{"question": "Chiropractic vs. acupuncture?", "patient_answer": "i can speak freely on behalf on chiropractic as i myself am a chiropractor.  my life has been changed for the better because of my profession.  it not only deals with correcting dysfunction of the spine and muscles attached but also works to ensure a properly functioning nervous system.  since the nervous system controls every function of the body it is paramount that we keep it healthy.  not only does chiropractic help with nerve interference that leads to sensory/pain problems, but also conditions that are not at all sensory related.\ni hope that helps!", "doctor_answer": "I have been to chiropractors and had temporary results.

{"question": "Is it dangerous to get in a tanning bed while your pregnant?", "patient_answer": "While there is no evidence that a fetus is affected by its mothers' exposure to either the natural sun or indoor tanning equipment, a potential drawback to tanning during pregnancy may be the risk of the woman's body overheating. Pregnant women are cautioned to avoid prolonged sauna and whirlpool exposure due to the possible harm to the fetus from the rise in the woman's core body temperature. Core body temperature is the temperature of the blood as it is pumped from the heart, which normally ranges from 99 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Extended periods of sauna or whirlpool exposures or prolonged vigorous exercise may actually cause this temperature to rise. This rise in body temperature could result in developmental damage or possibly death to the fetus.", "doctor_answer": "I've heard both points of view, but MOST doctors just recommend staying away from it while pregnant.

{"question": "how do i gain weight?", "patient_answer": "Sumo wrestlers only eat one time a day. It slows down your metabolism.

{"question": "what are the important effects of greeg tea?", "patient_answer": "All tea comes from the same plant--black, green, and oolong teas all have the same parents. The difference in the teas lies in how the teas are prepared after picking. Black and oolong tea are fermented, but Green tea is not. Therefore the active constituents remain unaltered in green tea. The most important ingredient in green tea is the phytonutrient eppigallocatchin or EGCG for short. This substance is a polyphenolic compound that acts as an antioxidant.\n\nWhat does EGCG do?\nResearch has shown that these polyphenolic antioxidants protects the body against cardiovascular disease, and promote a healthy immune system. However in this new research, Professor Roger Thornley in England states, “We have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme DHFR or dihydrofolate which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs. This is the first time to our knowledge a known target for an anti-cancer drug has been identified as being inhibited by EGCG.” The scientist continued by saying that EGCG is probably just one of a number of anti-cancer mechanisms in green tea.\n\nIt's also said to help reduce bad Cholestrol among many other help benefits which are still being researched. You will find several books and online claims about green tea - most of them are true but not all of them have been published in scientific journals yet because enough research has not been done yet.\n\nIn short - it's good for you!", "doctor_answer": "as oppossed to coffee, green tea has an alkalizing affect on the body whereas coffee is acidic. our typical diet is all ready too acidic. \njust about anything green/fruits/vegetables  helps us this way. Green tea also has a lot of antioxidants"}

{"question": "is ther a way of removing gall stones without surgery?", "patient_answer": "There is often some confusion on the difference between gallstones and kidney stones.  Kidney stones form in urine in the kidneys (redundant, I know, but hang in there).  They are most commonly calcium oxalate (but calcium doesn't cause the stones!).  In order for them to be passed without surgery, they have to go through the ureters to the urine bladder, and then through the urethra to exit the body.\n\nGallstones are formed in the gall bladder which stores bile created by the liver.  They are most commonly formed of cholesterol.  The gall bladder pumps bile into the top of the small intestine, where it helps digest fats and fat soluble vitamins.  And here's the big difference.  If a gallstone actually makes it out of the gallbladder, it will enter the small intestines and leave the body in feces.  \n\nThe bile duct, btw, is normally about 4mm but may go up to 7mm if there are lodged stones.  \n\nNow consider what someone who is claiming that their solution will allow gallstones to pass the body (with pictures!) is supposedly doing to find these gallstones.\n\n(And because I can't resist a good line)  If you pee it out, it's a kidney stone, if you poop it out it's a gallstone.\n\n\nNow, having said all of that, I see that the Mayo clinic does have a sound wave treatment for gallstones, but they indicate that it is appropriate for only a small number of cases.  And that the gallstones will come back on you unless you take a special medicine for the rest of your life.\n\nYou can try to control your gallstones by eating a very low fat, cholesterol controlling diet.  This might keep the stones from getting larger.  However, you will need to keep an eye on them, as they can get large enough to cause more serious problems than pain.", "doctor_answer": "I am givig you a link for a site that will answer you question and many more medical questions you may have. I have personaly done the liver/gall bladder flush with positive results and most people caan avoid surgery using this method. If you have trouble finding it let me know and i'll get the whole outline for you."}
{"question": "water??really??", "patient_answer": "not only does it keep you hydrated, but it also keeps your body functions regular, and helps your kidneys. your body is 70% water, you know?!? you need to keep that level up! it also keeps your skin moisturized when out in the sun and what not. gives you a healthy glow! drink plenty!!", "doctor_answer": "The human body needs water to maintain enough blood and other fluids to function properly.  Along with the fluids, the body also needs electrolytes, which are salts normally found in blood, other fluids, and cells. \n\nThe body may lose fluids in a variety of ways:\n\nwhen urinating \nwhen you vomit or have diarrhea \nwhen sweating \nfrom the lungs during normal breathing.\n\nIf the body loses a substantial amount of fluids and salts and they are not quickly replaced, for example, by drinking, the body starts to \"dry up\" or get dehydrated.\n\nSevere dehydration can cause death.\n\nWhen you feel thirsty, you have already begun to dehydrate, so it's best to drink water as often as possible, even when you're not thirsty."}
{"question": "Are there side effects of long time consumption of tranquilizer Xanax (.5 mg/day,  2 yrs now) ?", "patient_answer": "Well, that depends... Why are you on the drug in the first place? Yes. There are side effects involved with the long-term ingestion of any benzodiazepine type anti-anxiolytic. For the most part, they are withdrawal effects. Higher doses taken for longer periods of time will produce more discomfort when trying to stop the drug. This MUST be done with the help of a physician, and MUST be tapered slowly over a period of time depending on the half-life of the drug. However, if Xanax is helping you, and keeping an anxiety disorder \"under control\" -- you should carefully weigh the costs vs. benefits of stopping a helpful medication.\n\nThere are some very good nutritional strategies that can help with anxiety. You may want to check out your local health food store and get some suggestions. Alternative Medicine and Natural Healing information is also available. But please don't do anything without first consulting your physician! (Ask your pharmacist as well, they are a great source of untapped medical knowledge!)

It could be a pain coming from your lungs, or any of the other structures in the chest.  In case you're not aware, most pain from heart disease comes from the center of your chest. To get an accurate diagnosis from your symptoms, you'll need to tell the doctor more about the pain: e.g., when does the pain usually come on (when you're walking/running, when you're lying flat, in the middle of the night when you're sleeping, etc.), where in the chest it is, describe the type of pain (sharp, dull ache, pressure-sensation, etc.), does the pain appear to go to any other part of the body (like does it go down your left arm?), do you get short of breath when the pain comes on, and so on and so forth.

{"question": "what is a cure for TINNITUS?", "patient_answer": "Home Treatment\n\nThe following tips may help you reduce symptoms of tinnitus.\n\n-Cut back on or eliminate alcohol and beverages containing caffeine.\n\n-Stop smoking and stop using smokeless tobacco products. Nicotine use makes tinnitus worse by reducing blood flow to the structures of the ear.\n\n-Limit your use of aspirin, products containing aspirin, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen.\n\n-Exercise regularly. Exercise improves blood flow to the structures of the ear. However, avoid extended periods of exercise, such as bicycle riding, that keep your neck in a hyperextended position. For more information, see the topic Fitness. \n\nWhile waiting to see whether tinnitus goes away, or if your health professional has advised you that your tinnitus will be present for a long time, try these methods to cope with the constant noise:\n\n-Limit or avoid exposure to the noises you suspect are causing your tinnitus. If you cannot avoid loud noises, wear protective earplugs or earmuffs.\n\n-Try to ignore the sound by directing your attention to other things.\n\n-Practice relaxation techniques, such as biofeedback, meditation, or yoga. Stress and fatigue seem to make tinnitus worse.\n\n-Quiet rooms can cause tinnitus to seem more distracting. Background noise may reduce the amount of noise you hear. Play music or white noise when you are trying to fall asleep or anytime you find yourself in a quiet place. You may consider buying a machine that makes soothing sounds, such as ocean waves.\n\n-Try the herbal supplement ginkgo biloba. Some studies suggest that it may help relieve tinnitus, but other studies do not show a benefit. Further studies are needed to determine the best dosage.", "doctor_answer": "That first answer had a lot of hints and yet not the one that I know works - and that is to drink more water.  Dehydration is the basic cause of tinnitus.  Start drinking the 8 glasses (that's about 2 quarts a day).  Coffee doesn't count, it's a diuretic and depletes your system of water.\n\nWithout enough water, you can't wash away the toxins from your body.  For me, it's the easy answer that works."}

{"question": "when breast cancer is the size of a quarter, how serious is it?", "patient_answer": "you need to see a doctor NOW!", "doctor_answer": "Any amount of cancer is a bad thing -- it is a serious thing and warrants medical intervention. ASAP!\n\nIf you are asking about prognosis, there are lots of variables in play as to prognosis of the person you know (I am assuming it is you for the remainder of the answer). Lots of things can enter the equation -- general physical health, specific type of cancer, other health conditions, where it has spread to (if any), treatment choices, age, nutrition, etc. And it is important to remember that lots of people survive breast cancer. \n\nI would start by seeing a medical oncologist and/or oncologic surgeon -- ideally one who tends to focus on breast cancers. They will be in the best position to offer treatment alternatives and outlooks. Think about what questions you want to answer and write them down before you go. Take someone with you -- task them with being sure all of your questions get asked and have them take notes. Don't hesitate to ask the doctor to slow down or provide more information. If you are interested in prognosis and treatment alternatives -- ask! Some patients seem to prefer less information in that area and some mds wait for the topic to be brought up.\n\nOdds are that they will need to conduct additional tests (to determine the specific type and to see if it has spread).  That is normal."}
{"question": "what is an aflatoxin?", "patient_answer": "PROPERTIES OF AFLATOXIN AND IT PRODUCING FUNGI\n\n\nReddy,S.V. and Farid Waliyar \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMany agricultural commodities are vulnerable to attack by a group of fungi that are able to produce toxic metabolites called mycotoxins. Among various mycotoxins, aflatoxins have assumed significance due to their deleterious effects on human beings, poultry and livestock. The aflatoxin problem was first recognized in 1960, when there was severe outbreak of a disease referred as \"Turkey 'X' Disease\" in UK, in which over 100,000 turkey poults were died. The cause of the disease was shown due to toxins in peanut meal infected with Aspergillus flavus and the toxins were named as aflatoxins.\n\nNatural occurrence:\n\nFood products contaminated with aflatoxins include cereal (maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, wheat), oilseeds (groundnut, soybean, sunflower, cotton), spices (chillies, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, zinger), tree nuts (almonds, pistachio, walnuts, coconut) and milk. \n\nPhysical and chemical properties:\n\nAflatoxins are potent toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunosuppressive agents, produced as secondary metabolites by the fungus Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus on variety of food products. Among 18 different types of aflatoxins identified, major members are aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is normally predominant in amount in cultures as well as in food products. Pure AFB1 is pale-white to yellow crystalline, odorless solid. Aflatoxins are soluble in methanol, chloroform, actone, acetonitrile. A. flavus typically produces AFB1 and AFB2, where as A. parasiticus produce AFG1 and AFG2 as well as AFB1 and AFB2. Four other aflatoxins M1, M2, B2A, G2A which may be produced in minor amounts were subsequently isolated from cultures of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A number of closely related compounds namely aflatoxin GM1, parasiticol and aflatoxicol are also produced by A. flavus. Aflatoxin M1and M2 are major metabolites of aflatoxin B1 and B2 respectively, found in milk of animals that have consumed feed contaminated with aflatoxins.", "doctor_answer": "Aflatoxins are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus; but most notably Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic to animals, including humans. After entering the body, aflatoxins are metabolized by the liver to an intermediate reactive, aflatoxin M1, an epoxide."}

{"question": "HOW DO U GET RID OF ACNE?", "patient_answer": "DISCLAIMER: Before using any medicines, you should consult a registered physiscian. This is only for information.\n\nAcne Treatment\n\n|Self-Care at Home|\n\n    * Wash once or twice daily with soap and water to remove excess oil from the skin. An acne cleanser purchased over-the-counter in any drug store can also be helpful. Avoid scrubbing too abrasively because this can actually irritate the skin and cause acne to worsen.\n\n    * Over-the-counter acne medications can be used either at bedtime or during the day. Always follow the directions on any acne product.\n\n    * Many cover-up products are available without a prescription to improve the appearance of blemishes while they have a chance to heal. Most work well and should not worsen acne.\n\n    * Some cosmetics and other skin care products, however, can cause acne to worsen. Look for make-up, cosmetics, and skin care products labeled with the word noncomedogenic. This means that it does not cause or worsen acne.\n\n|Medical Treatment|\n\nMany treatment options are available to treat all forms of acne. Medications are the main treatment for acne and usually work well. Several preparations are available over-the-counter, while others require a prescription from a doctor.\n\n    * Over-the-counter medications: Nonprescription or over-the-counter medications for acne are plentiful and can be effective for milder forms of acne. They come in the form of soaps, washes, and cleansers.\n\n          o Many contain benzoyl peroxide, which does two things. First, benzoyl peroxide kills the acne-causing bacteria, which are thought to play a role in acne. Second, benzoyl peroxide can cause drying and flaking off of skin, which can help prevent the pores from becoming plugged. Plugged pores can develop into acne blemishes.\n\n          o Scrubbing excessively with any over-the-counter preparation can actually cause acne to worsen by additionally irritating the hair follicles.\n\n    * Prescription medications: Doctors can prescribe medications when acne becomes moderate to severe or is not controlled by over-the-counter medications. Prescription drugs can be used effectively alone or in combination with other prescription and nonprescription medications.\n\n          o Antibiotics: Antibiotics can be effective in treating most inflammatory acne (papules and pustules). They work by killing the bacteria and also by decreasing the redness and swelling seen in the inflammatory forms of acne.\n\n                + Antibiotics may be applied to the skin in the form of gels and lotions, or by way of pills. We now know that using a combination of 2 medications together may be very effective in treating acne. Using a topical antibiotic with topical benzoyl peroxide, for example, may prevent bacterial resistance to the antibiotic. Giving an antibiotic by mouth is often needed for acne that is more extensive, red, and tender.\n\n                + Antibiotics taken by mouth can be associated with more side effects than if applied to the skin and may interact with other medicines such as birth control pills. Sensitivity to the sun can result in a \"bad sunburn\" in some people who take the antibiotic tetracycline by mouth.\n\n          o Retinoids: Medicines made from vitamin A (retinoids) are useful in treating several types of acne lesions. Topical retinoids are effective in treating the noninflammatory types of acne (blackheads and whiteheads).\n\n                + Topical retinoids (applied directly to the skin) help to open clogged pores by creating a mild peeling effect. Drying of the skin can be a frequent side effect. Oral retinoids are reserved for treating the more extensive nodular type of acne or severe inflammatory acne, which has not responded to other treatments. Oral retinoids not only have a peeling effect but also decrease the production of oil.\n\n                + They can also be associated with a number of serious side effects including birth defects in babies of wome", "doctor_answer": "GET PROACTIVE--IT DOES WORK"}

{"question": "whats an enema like?", "patient_answer": "something I wouldnt wish on anyone. Had one done with mineral oil once. It was the worst thing ever. The liquid was no big deal. Then about 30min later I had lower tummy pain. Then I had to use the bathroom frequently and I know I ruined a pair of underwear due to this procedure.", "doctor_answer": "Think of it as part of your hygiene, and give yourself plenty of time.  Prepare for some mild cramping -- you colon is doing it's job as it eliminates.\n\nNo need for it often.  Once a week won't hurt.  You'll get used to it.  Work it into you hygiene rituals.\n\nWater is all you need, NOT HOT though.  NEVER use alcohol like subtances.  Death could result.  Colon is, of course, very absorbant.\n\nYou should check with a health provider rather than take anyone's word here without question."}
{"question": "why is it that insurance companies pay for viagra, but not birth control?", "patient_answer": "Lets bring this to a vote", "doctor_answer": "birth control is a lifestyle choice - not a medical problem - for most people.  Some people use it for treatment of some problems - like PCOS - and you have grounds for an appeal with the insurance company with this.  If its just for contraception - that is not a medical condition, and they wont cover it."}
