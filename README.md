## 🩺 Introduction
The Medical Summarization Challenge required building a custom model capable of generating *perspective-aware medical summaries* from Q&A pairs.  
No external APIs or pre-built LLMs were allowed. Teams had to design, train, or modify their own architectures for medical text summarization.

The model provides *dual perspectives*:  
- *Patient-Friendly Summaries:* Simplified, jargon-free, actionable information.  
- *Clinician-Focused Summaries:* Detailed, technical, medically relevant content.  

---

## 📝 Problem Statement
The challenge focused on:  
- Creating a *lightweight model* without external API calls.  
- Ensuring *dual-perspective outputs* for patients and clinicians.  
- Maintaining *safety disclaimers and provenance tracking*.  
- Building a *browser/web app* for accessibility.  
- Working with the given *Medical Q&A dataset*.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Our solution integrates multiple layers of *preprocessing, classification, and summarization*:

*Workflow:*
1. *Input Layer:* Accepts scanned PDFs, clinical notes, and Q&A pairs.  
2. *Preprocessing:* OCR for scanned PDFs, text cleaning, and formatting.  
3. *Section Classification:* Segmentation into categories like Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment.  
4. *Summarization Module:*  
   - Patient-friendly summaries (simple language, minimal jargon).  
   - Clinician-focused summaries (medical terminology, detailed insights).  
5. *Post-Processing:* Adds provenance tracking and mandatory safety disclaimers.  
6. *Deployment:* Delivered via a *browser-based web application*.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
We measured the model on:  
- *Readability Index:* Ensuring patients could easily understand.  
- *Medical Accuracy:* Validating correctness with medical references.  
- *Human Evaluation:* Testing real user comprehension and clinical usability.

---

## 🌟 Impact
- *For Patients:* Clear understanding, reduced anxiety.  
- *For Clinicians:* Time-saving, reliable summaries for decision support.  
- *For Healthcare Systems:* Improved doctor-patient communication and efficiency.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Multilingual Support for diverse patients.  
- Voice-Based Summaries for accessibility.  
- Real-Time Updates from live Q&A.  
- Interactive Q&A Systems integrated with the summarizer.

---

## 💰 Revenue Model
- Subscription Plans for individuals.  
- Advertisements & Sponsored Content.  
- Consulting & Custom Solutions.  
- B2B Integrations with healthcare providers and hospitals.

---

## 🛠 Our Journey
Our hackathon journey included:  
- Handling scanned PDFs and cleaning medical text using OCR.  
- Designing a model balancing readability and accuracy.  
- Deploying a lightweight yet effective browser-based solution.  
- Overcoming obstacles in model architecture design.  
- Team collaboration, constant iteration, and late-night debugging.  
- Persistence and iterative problem-solving led to a working solution.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This journey was about *resilience, innovation, and collaboration*.  
Our solution demonstrates that medical summarization can be made *accessible, reliable, and impactful* for both patients and clinicians.  

We, *NeuroSpartans*, are proud to present our solution in the Final Round.
