[{"question": "what is orgasm?", "patient_answer": "An orgasm, also known as a sexual climax, is a pleasurable physical, psychological or emotional response to prolonged sexual stimulation. It is often accompanied by a notable physiological reaction, such as ejaculation, blushing or spasm and may be followed by aftershocks.\n\nDictionaries still give the subsidiary meaning, \"a similar point of intensity of emotional excitement,\" but as of 2005 this usage has become obscure. It can be startling to modern readers when encountered in older literature.\n\n\nGeneral\nBoth males and females can experience orgasm, but the exact response varies across gender. Generally speaking, orgasm is the third stage of four in the human sexual response cycle, which is the currently accepted model of the physiological process of sexual stimulation", "doctor_answer": "You asked two questions that you might think are the same; but they are not. Orgasm is an experience resulting from the combined effects of physical stimulation, emotional bonding, intellectual intimacy and total surrender or giving to the experience of the moment that crest or climax in overwhelming sensual and spiritual thunderclaps.\n\nMany concepts may play a role in building orgasm, including thinking about making a baby, dominance and submission, etc.\n\nTrue love might be a component of a good orgasm, but is itself different and in the long term more fundamental than the orgasm. Having orgasms with someone you love is wonderful, but the existence of the orgasms does not in and of itself serve to indicate whether the relationship will endure over a long term."}, {"question": "when mutiple women live in the same house for extend periods of time do their periods really start to sycnrani", "patient_answer": "Apparently so.", "doctor_answer": "they sure do.  and call it a blessing, instead of continuous PMS it's all over at the same time."}, {"question": "I am extremely tired and an slowly gaining weight even though I diet-What's wrong with me?", "patient_answer": "it sounds alot like hypothyroidism which meens that your body is not producing enough thyroid hormones. this can cause you to gain weight and lack energy.\n\nalso sounds like possible depression so see a doctor.", "doctor_answer": "You need to do more in order for you to lose the weight although you say you are active.Your metabolism slows as we age and you need to keep your metabolism going or you will be gaining weight and at risk for complications or dieases.\nWhen you are at home at night, walk for 30 minutes before you sit down to eat."}, {"question": "What are the leading factors for an inability to lose weight, given the following assumptions?", "patient_answer": "It is possible to not eat enough to keep your metabolism functioning without a thyroid problem.

My uncle had to stop soda altogether because of this (good luck!):\n\nAn ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. \n\nThere are two main types of ulcers- \n\nPeptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. \n\nDuodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. \n\nHow do you know if you have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. \n\nIntense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. \n\nThere may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. \n\nThere are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium \"H. pylori\" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. \n\nSome medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding. \n\nTense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. \"The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide\" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. \n\nAlthough uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. \n\n\n\nWhen a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage. \n\nIf you find the above mentioned symptoms, contact the doctor. Immediate medical attention should be given if the patient is vomiting blood, has cold skin accompanied by sweating, faintness, weakness, or is experiencing extreme pain. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for prompt healing and also to prevent the ulcer from coming back. \n\nThe above is provided for your information, but you are responsible for your own actions to deal with your ulcers or gastro esophageal health problems.

They have an illness that requires biomedical treatment. People often assume that because addiction begins with a voluntary behavior and is expressed in the form of excess behavior, an addict should just be able to quit by force of will alone. However, it is essential to understand when dealing with addicts that we are dealing with individuals whose brains have been altered by alcohol, drug or behavioral abuse. They need addiction treatment.\n\nToday, scientists and physicians overwhelmingly agree that while use and even abuse of drugs such as alcohol and cocaine is a behavior over which the individual exerts control, addiction to these substances is something different.

They may also occur during pregnancy. Such murmurs are called \"innocent\" heart murmurs. They are not associated with medical or heart conditions, and do not require treatment or lifestyle changes.\n\n\nThough many murmurs are innocent, some may indicate serious heart problems. For instance, heart murmurs may be caused by blood flowing through a heart valve made leaky or narrow by disease. Murmurs can also be caused by increased blood flow across a valve as a result of medical conditions such as anemia or hypothyroidism. Congenital cardiac defects (heart problems present at birth) can also cause heart murmurs. These often can be repaired with surgery.\n\nWithin the heart there are four chambers separated from each other by valves, or flaps, that regulate how much blood enters each chamber at any time. Healthy valves also help prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction in your heart.\n\nA healthy heart makes a \"lub-dub\" sound as it beats. The \"lub\" (systolic sound) happens when part of the heart contracts and the mitral and tricuspid valves close, and the \"dub\" (diastolic sound) occurs when part of the heart relaxes and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. A heart murmur is an extra sound, such as a whooshing, in the heartbeat caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves.\n\nHeart murmurs can be heard through a stethoscope and often are detected during routine physical examinations. On further examination, your doctor may find that the heart murmur is innocent. If your heart murmur is related to more serious heart problems, your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist). Medication or surgery may be recommended to treat the underlying problem. He or she may also suggest that you take extra precautions against getting a heart infection, such as by taking antibiotics when you have dental work or some surgeries. With thorough examination and proper tests, your doctor should be able to tell what causes your heart murmur.\n\nSymptoms\nMany people with heart murmurs experience no symptoms. However, some murmurs can occur in conjunction with these other symptoms:\n\n    * Chest pain\n    * Rapid heartbeat (palpitations)\n    * Breathlessness\n    * Fatigue\n    * Bluish skin color or fingertips (sometimes seen in babies with congenital heart defects)", "doctor_answer": "it is a hole in the heart"}, {"question": "What are some non-expensive ways to get rid of a cold?", "patient_answer": "home made chicken soup", "doctor_answer": "Although it's a bit late now, the cheapest means of getting over a cold is a healthy diet, regular exercise, and a reduction of stress in your lifestyle. That's the best way to PREVENT the cold to begin with, making it the cheapest overall remedy.\n\nHere's something interesting: once you're showing the symptoms of a cold (sneezing, body aches, runny nose, etc.) you've already HAD the cold and your body is casting off the byproducts of the virus.\n\nAnd, because a cold is based in a virus, you don't really catch the same cold again. Your body adapts to that viral strain. If you catch another cold right after you just get over your last one, it's a new cold and you came down with it because your immune system was already depressed from the most recent one."}, {"question": "HOW DO U GET RID OF ACNE?", "patient_answer": "DISCLAIMER: Before using any medicines, you should consult a registered physiscian. This is only for information.\n\nAcne Treatment\n\n|Self-Care at Home|\n\n    * Wash once or twice daily with soap and water to remove excess oil from the skin. An acne cleanser purchased over-the-counter in any drug store can also be helpful. Avoid scrubbing too abrasively because this can actually irritate the skin and cause acne to worsen.\n\n    * Over-the-counter acne medications can be used either at bedtime or during the day. Always follow the directions on any acne product.\n\n    * Many cover-up products are available without a prescription to improve the appearance of blemishes while they have a chance to heal. Most work well and should not worsen acne.\n\n    * Some cosmetics and other skin care products, however, can cause acne to worsen. Look for make-up, cosmetics, and skin care products labeled with the word noncomedogenic. This means that it does not cause or worsen acne.\n\n|Medical Treatment|\n\nMany treatment options are available to treat all forms of acne. Medications are the main treatment for acne and usually work well. Several preparations are available over-the-counter, while others require a prescription from a doctor.\n\n    * Over-the-counter medications: Nonprescription or over-the-counter medications for acne are plentiful and can be effective for milder forms of acne. They come in the form of soaps, washes, and cleansers.\n\n          o Many contain benzoyl peroxide, which does two things. First, benzoyl peroxide kills the acne-causing bacteria, which are thought to play a role in acne. Second, benzoyl peroxide can cause drying and flaking off of skin, which can help prevent the pores from becoming plugged. Plugged pores can develop into acne blemishes.\n\n          o Scrubbing excessively with any over-the-counter preparation can actually cause acne to worsen by additionally irritating the hair follicles.\n\n    * Prescription medications: Doctors can prescribe medications when acne becomes moderate to severe or is not controlled by over-the-counter medications. Prescription drugs can be used effectively alone or in combination with other prescription and nonprescription medications.\n\n          o Antibiotics: Antibiotics can be effective in treating most inflammatory acne (papules and pustules). They work by killing the bacteria and also by decreasing the redness and swelling seen in the inflammatory forms of acne.\n\n                + Antibiotics may be applied to the skin in the form of gels and lotions, or by way of pills. We now know that using a combination of 2 medications together may be very effective in treating acne. Using a topical antibiotic with topical benzoyl peroxide, for example, may prevent bacterial resistance to the antibiotic. Giving an antibiotic by mouth is often needed for acne that is more extensive, red, and tender.\n\n                + Antibiotics taken by mouth can be associated with more side effects than if applied to the skin and may interact with other medicines such as birth control pills. Sensitivity to the sun can result in a \"bad sunburn\" in some people who take the antibiotic tetracycline by mouth.\n\n          o Retinoids: Medicines made from vitamin A (retinoids) are useful in treating several types of acne lesions. Topical retinoids are effective in treating the noninflammatory types of acne (blackheads and whiteheads).\n\n                + Topical retinoids (applied directly to the skin) help to open clogged pores by creating a mild peeling effect. Drying of the skin can be a frequent side effect. Oral retinoids are reserved for treating the more extensive nodular type of acne or severe inflammatory acne, which has not responded to other treatments. Oral retinoids not only have a peeling effect but also decrease the production of oil.\n\n                + They can also be associated with a number of serious side effects including birth defects in babies of wome", "doctor_answer": "GET PROACTIVE--IT DOES WORK"}, {"question": "IS THERE ANY CURE FOR AASTHAMA?", "patient_answer": "Yes, It makes me feel so good to deliver the answer to this question.\n\nKombucha is a fungus you grow in tea and and it makes the tea extremely healthy with enzimes, antioxodents, vitamins, and the cure to many things.

Each cell is so small you would need a powerful microscope for looking at 100 of them.\n\nAll cells are surrounded by a membrane.  Somewhat like a very, very tiny balloon filled with salty jello.  The insides of the outermost cells are salty and dehydrated because your skin grows from underneath, the dermis, close to the capillaries (blood supply).\n\nThe outer skin, called the epidermis, consists of cells which are wearing out and drying up, although they are mostly not quite dead yet.  The very oldest ones that are dead come off when you scrub or shower. Some are falling off all the time, but they are so small you do not see them.\n\nSince the epidermis consists of rather dry cells, it is able to absorb water.  The cell walls allow the water in your tub, shower, or pool to penetrate into each cell.  The insides, being salty, are have a strong affinity for water.  \n\nIf you spend a long time in the water, the epidermal cells swell up, increasing in size, somewhat like the the balloons mentioned earlier being filled with more water.\n\nWhen the skin on the outside of your hands or toes swells it has more surface area than previously.  Instead of being like a tight fitting glove, it becomes more like a glove that is too big.\n\nIf you put on a glove that is too big, it will have wrinkles instead of being stretched smoothly.\n\nThe entry of water into a cell is called osmosis.  If you stay in fresh water for an extremely long time, many cells will absorb so much water they will burst.  That is called lysis.\n\nRed blood cells are much more fragile than skin cells.  When combined with fresh water they rapidly absorb so much water that they all appear to dissolve.  Each one of the millions and millions of red blood cells has burst.  That is called hemolysis.\n\nRopes made from plant fibers are also composed of cells.  Test a rope:  See if it shrinks in length when absorbing water or drying out.\n\nWhen the skin on your fingers and toes dries out, the cells shrink in size, and the skin becomes more smooth and taut, like a tight, well fitted glove.\n\nYour skin is very important.  Without it you would be just like a raw piece of meat, ready for the flies and germs to eat.\n\nTake good care of your skin.  Do not get sunburned.

But as many as 15 percent of these babies develop one or more neurological abnormalities — such as mental retardation, learning disabilities, hearing or vision loss — usually in the first year or two of life. Congenital CMV infection is a leading cause of hearing loss in children.\n\nAbout one in 1,000 babies (about 4,000 babies each year) shows symptoms of CMV at birth. These symptoms may include an enlarged spleen or liver, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and a distinctive rash. Up to 20 percent of these babies die, and about 90 percent of the survivors suffer from serious neurological defects, such as mental retardation.\n\nAt present there is no treatment that can halt or reverse the effects of congenital CMV. However, doctors are investigating whether a new antiviral drug called ganciclovir — which is used to treat adults with AIDS who have CMV-related eye infections — also may help babies with congenital CMV."}, {"question": "how risky is the surgery to remove the tonsils?", "patient_answer": "It is pretty straightforward minor surgery but in general all surgery has risks-  there is no type of surgery that doesn't.", "doctor_answer": "It's one of the least risky surgeries, but you may want to keep in mind that your tonsils perform the important function of catching a lot of germs before they get further into your system, so unless you have a specific problem and need them removed, you may want to just hang on to them."}, {"question": "is a no carb diet good or bad? plz help?", "patient_answer": "no carb diets are bad for you. this means you are eating meat which clogs up your arterys improving your chances of cardiovascular disease and stroke.

Touch your face as little as possible, and only when your hands are clean.\n \n3. Avoid squeezing pimples. Bacteria on your hands or on unsterile equipment can lead to more blemishes and possible scarring.\n \n4. Steam your face once or twice a week to help open the pores. Boil water, remove the pot from the stove, drape a towel over your head and hold your face over the pot. Then rinse your face with cold water. \n \n5. Use essential oils such as calendula, chamomile, juniper, lavendar and mint directly on your skin. Mix 10 drops of any of the oils with 2 tbsp. soy or almond oil, and smooth a few drops on dampened skin.\n \n6. Try using herbs. Saw palmetto can help balance boys' hormones, while chaste tree berry can do the same for girls. Echinacea, alfalfa, burdock root, cayenne, chaparral and yellow dock root are also helpful.\n \n7. Consider other topical mixtures. Beat an egg yolk, apply it with a cotton ball and leave it on for 15 minutes. Alternatively, mix oatmeal and honey together to form a paste and apply it to your face.

The doctor diagnoses hernia by doing a physical exam and by taking x rays and blood tests to check for blockage in the intestine.\n\nThe main treatment for inguinal hernia is surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. This surgery is called herniorrhaphy. Sometimes the weak area is reinforced with steel mesh or wire. This operation is called hernioplasty.

It is most obvious in the skin; however, the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory, renal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems, as well as numerous vascular structures, are involved frequently. The symptoms result from progressive tissue fibrosis and occlusion of the microvasculature by excessive production and deposition of types I and III collagens. Other macromolecules found in the connective tissue (eg, glycosaminoglycans, tenascin, fibronectin) also are increased. The vascular alterations show a predilection for affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. The small vessel cytoskeleton is affected by structural defects that lead to collapse. Next, the tight junctions become altered and are no longer functional, allowing the endothelium to slip into the vessel lumen.\n\nFrom webmd:  Scleroderma (pronounced SKLEER-oh-der-ma) is Greek for hard skin. It's classified as both a connective-tissue disorder and a rheumatic condition. In scleroderma, the skin gradually tightens and thickens or hardens. It loses its ability to stretch.

I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies.

This is where fresh oxygenated blood is pumped out to the entire body.  There are a variety of diseases that can require replacement of this valve, including aortic stenosis where the valve does not properly open and close, or an aortic insufficiency where the valve allows backflow of blood from the aorta back into the left ventricle of the heart.\n\nThere are two major types of aortic valve replacements - mechanical valves and biologic/tissue valves.  Mechanical valves have been around longer and subsequently have a very refined safety and efficacy profile.  The downside is that after the procedure, the patient must be put on blood thinners for the rest of their life.  Biologic/tissue valves do not need subsequent blood thinner treatment and therefore may benefit younger, generally healthy patients.  However, it has been shown that the durability of tissue valves may be lower than mechanical valves, which may require a repeat operation later in life.\n\nThere is a variation to the above procedures called the Ross procedure.  This procedure replaces the faulty aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve.  The pulmonary valve is then replaced with a tissue valve.  The rationale for doing this is that more strain is put on the aortic valve and therefore having the person's own anatomy in that place is preferable to having a weaker mechanical or tissue valve.  The pulmonary valve, which only pumps to the lungs (and therefore doesn't have to pump as hard) can withstand having a tissue valve, which isn't as durable.  In addition, this approach does not require blood thinners after the operation.\n\nCurrent cardiac surgery research is trying to investigate if valve replacement can be done in a minimally invasive way using catheter devices."}, {"question": "i am 25, and i am having changes, like more hair all over my body, zits in my face, why is this happening?", "patient_answer": "If you are a woman, then you need to get your hormone levels checked, ASAP!!!!!", "doctor_answer": "Coz buddy ur growing up, this might be the last changes of ur body hormones...confirm that with ur doctor!!!!"}, {"question": "how do you get raid of belly fat?", "patient_answer": "not only do you need to work your ab muscles (by doing crunches and sit ups) you need to exercise and eat right too.

You may feel better if you eat light, easily digested foods, such as soup. Many people find that taking a lukewarm [80° (26.7°) to 90° (32.2°)] shower or bath makes them feel better when they have a fever. Do not try to take a shower if you are dizzy or unsteady on your feet. Increase the water temperature if you start to shiver. Shivering is a sign that your body is trying to raise its temperature. Do not use rubbing alcohol, ice, or cold water to cool your body. Dress lightly when you have a fever. This will help your body cool down. Wear light pajamas or a light undershirt. Do not wear very warm clothing or use heavy bed covers. Keep room temperature at 70° (21.1°) or lower.

The disease takes its less-scientific name from Lou Gehrig, a baseball player with the New York Yankees in the late 1920s and 1930s, who was forced to retire in 1939 as a result of the loss of motor control caused by the disease. \n\nIn 1991, a team of researchers linked familial ALS to chromosome 21. Two years later, the SOD1 gene was identified as being associated with many cases of familial ALS. The enzyme coded for by SOD1 carries out a very important function in cells: it removes dangerous superoxide radicals by converting them into non-harmful substances. Defects in the action of this enzyme mean that the superoxide radicals attack cells from the inside, causing their death. Several different mutations in this enzyme all result in ALS, making the exact molecular cause of the disease difficult to ascertain.\n\nRecent research has suggested that treatment with drugs called antioxidants may benefit ALS patients. However, since the molecular genetics of the disease are still unclear, a significant amount of research is still required to design other promising treatments for ALS"}, {"question": "i am having some headaches,backaches,stomache problems,dizziness,and i already had my period.what could this b", "patient_answer": "It could be the flu.

I recently started again a few years ago and have been off of it for a little over a year and my period still isn't regular. My OB/GYN said that it can take up to 2 years for your body to rid itself of the birth control (whether it be the pill or the shot) and go back to normal. Just be patient. It'll balance out eventually.", "doctor_answer": "Early menopause is often an over looked cause. Birth control pills, also causes frequent missed periods.\n\nNevertheless, you should contact a Physician/Gynecologist in your area in regards to this issue so that he/she can rule out the possibility of a tumor. Amenorrhea (Absence of Menstruation) is actually only a symptom resulting from a glandular malfunction, a chronic disease, a metabolic disorder such as diabetes, obesity, malnutrition, and tumors, or more importantly, a neurosis precipitated by emotional distress (unhappy love affair, divorce, and the like). However, hormonal treatment is most frequently employed when the possibility of tumor has been ruled out; while neurotic disorders may require psychiatric help, but even in this case, hormonal theraphy can be very helpful.\n\nAgain, much depends on the underlying trouble; some cases can be completly cured, for others medical help is limited.

While it is still a very serious and often fatal disease, it is not the death sentence that it was 20 years ago.  Things like protease inhibitors and strong antibiotics for some opportunistic infections have very much changed the way the disease is managed in a given patient.", "doctor_answer": "Before you can donate blood you have to be at NO risk for having the disease (as well as several other diseases such as malaria). You are tested before you can give blood to make sure you do not have any blood born diseases. \n\nAs for doctors, nurses, etc... they are at risk for getting HIV anytime they treat a patient. There is a protocol if you think you have been infected where you take certain medications within 1 hour of the event, for up to 6 months. This MAY prevent the disease.\n\nThere is no cure since most people are not aware they got AIDS until a longer period of time into the illness. The virus is very tricky because it mutates all the time, thus we are unable to design a drug that will work with any mutant form of the virus.

Plus, ibuprofen and aspirin can cause stomach problems if you start raising the dosage.  \n\nThere is a solution- topical administration.  Ask your doctor for a prescription for ibuprofen cream.  It is usually called something else, like ketoprofen, and can be made with a topical pain-reliever such as bupivicane (like lidocaine).  Keep in mind your doctor may not have heard of it, and that it has to be compounded.  Check your phonebook for local compounding pharmacies so that you can give your doctor their phone number. Typically the cream comes as 10-20% active, which is possible because it will never be in your stomach to cause problems.  Unfortunately, because it has to be compounded, your insurance company will probably not cover it in the same way as regular drugs.  You may be looking at paying $50 for a 4oz jar. \n\nWhen you apply- be sure to really rub and massage the cream into your hands hard for 5-10 minutes.

Fat is created by eating excess calories and it is primarily stored in layers on top of your muscles. Muscle tissue consists of fibers that contract to produce movement.\n\nFat can't turn into muscle, and muscle can't turn into fat. But you can lose muscle mass while you gain fat. That's what happens to most people, especially as they begin to get a little older.\n\nSo if your goal is a trim waist line and a nice flat stomach, the first thing you need to do is remove the layers of fat that are sitting on top of your abs. Everyone has a flat stomach. It's just that some of them are covered with excess fat. \n\nThe most effective way to flatten your stomach is with a combination of strength training (placing an extra focus on the mid-section), cardiovascular exercises (short, intensive workouts), and a stable blood sugar level to keep you from adding even more fat (and it makes it easier for the body to use your body fat for fuel). \nYou have to do some type of progressive strength training. The ab muscle is primarily used to flex your torso forward. But there are also muscles that flex your torso to the side and other muscles that rotate it. Often you will see people on their ab roller every day doing lots of sit-ups or crunches. \n\nIf you want to effectively strengthen your stomach muscles you need to incorporate these exercises: \n  \n1-2 forward flexion exercises (sit-up, crunch, etc.) \n  \n1-2 side flexion exercises (side crunches, side bends, etc.) \n  \n1-2 rotational exercises (standing twists, trunk rotations, etc.)\n  \nYour abs are muscles, and just like any other muscles, they should be exercised at most 3 times per week. You also want to make sure you're training them progressively, which means working them harder each time. \n  \nIncrease metabolism using short, and hard, cardio workouts. Cardio workouts are very important because they can, if done properly, increase your metabolism for up to 24 hours or more!\n\nThis means that you're less likely to store any excess calories as body fat simply because they're more likely to be used up by your higher metabolism. Plus, you're more likely to burn off some excess body fat in the process! \n\nHere's a simple interval workout that you can do with just about any activity (bicycling, walking, swimming, etc).\n  \nWarm up at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes \n  \nPerform 30 seconds of hard exercise (almost as hard as possible) \n  \nperform one minute of moderate exercise (recovery time to catch your breath) \n  \nRepeat this process from 6-10 times \n  \nCool down at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes  \n  \nMaintaining a stable blood sugar level is the key. Most importantly, you have to stabilize your blood sugar level! This is by far the most important factor when it comes to shedding that excess body fat and keeping it off!\n\nTo stabilize your blood sugar level you have to feed your body frequently, about every 2-3 hours. The key is to give your body only the amount of food that it needs at that time. Your body burns calories all day long, so why would you only feed it once or twice a day?\n\nGive your body the fuel it needs: fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins (fish, lean beef, chicken, eggs, etc). \n\nMost people pay too much attention to how much fat is in food, or how healthy a meal is. Calories are calories. It doesn’t matter where they come from. If there’s extra it's going to body fat! \n\nI'm not saying that what you eat isn't important because it is. It just doesn’t have all that much of an affect when it comes to losing fat.

Although schizophrenia affects men and women with equal frequency, the disorder often appears earlier in men, usually in the late teens or early twenties, than in women, who are generally affected in the twenties to early thirties. People with schizophrenia often suffer terrifying symptoms such as hearing internal voices not heard by others, or believing that other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts, or plotting to harm them. These symptoms may leave them fearful and withdrawn. Their speech and behavior can be so disorganized that they may be incomprehensible or frightening to others.

Constipation can be attributed to at least one of several factors: poor eating habits, lack of exercise, not eating enough fiber or drinking enough fluids, and even possibly serious illness.\n\nFortunately, there are things one can do to prevent constipation.\n\nSince dehydration can lead to constipation, one should always drink at least eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day. It’s best to avoid caffeine since it causes dehydration and can act as a diuretic. Those who do enjoy caffeinated beverages on a regular basis should do so in moderation.\n\nA healthy diet is key for preventing constipation. A high fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts ensures regularity. Consuming an apple every day, with its skin intact, is another sure way to prevent constipation. Guava is another helpful fruit, but it should be eaten with its seeds to ensure the full effect. Starchy foods should be avoided when one is constipated as this will only escalate the problem.\n\nRegular exercise will also assist in one’s quest for regularity. Even if it’s a daily stroll in the park, exercise is important.\n\nIf you’re feeling a little backed up, perhaps one or some of these remedies can help.\n\nLaxatives – There are many over the counter products to choose from in price ranges and formulas to suit everyone’s personal preference. If you’re not sure which product is right for you, check with your pharmacist or physician. Either is sure to recommend the product that is right for you. \nLemon and Honey – Mix two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of honey into a glass of warm water. Drink one glass in the morning and one in the evening to bring back regularity. \nOrange Juice and Olive Oil – Drink a glass or mug filled with half each of orange juice and olive oil. It may not taste great but it will have your plumbing running smoothly in no time. \nLicorice – Licorice has laxative qualities. Eating several pieces of real licorice will help to relieve your constipation. \nGrapes – A large bunch of grapes should do the trick. \nCastor oil and honey – Honey seems to appear in many remedies for constipation. In addition to taking it with lemon and even by itself, one can also mix one teaspoon of honey with one teaspoon of castor oil. \nSomething else a person who is suffering from constipation can try is a cup of tomato juice mixed with half a cup of sauerkraut juice and a quarter cup of carrot juice.

They are grouped in two ways. One way is by how quickly the disease develops and gets worse. The other way is by the type of blood cell that is affected.\n\nLeukemia is either acute or chronic. In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are blasts that remain very immature and cannot carry out their normal functions. The number of blasts increases rapidly, and the disease becomes worse quickly. In chronic leukemia, some blast cells are present, but in general, these cells are more mature and can carry out some of their normal functions. Also, the number of blasts increases less rapidly than in acute leukemia. As a result, chronic leukemia worsens gradually.\n\nLeukemia can arise in either of the two main types of white blood cells: lymphoid cells or myeloid cells. When leukemia affects lymphoid cells, it is called lymphocytic leukemia. When myeloid cells are affected, the disease is called myeloid or myelogenous leukemia.\n\nThese are the most common types of leukemia:\n\n1.Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. This disease also affects adults, especially those age 65 and older. \n2.Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in both adults and children. This type of leukemia is sometimes called acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). \n3.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most often affects adults over the age of 55. It sometimes occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. \n4.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurs mainly in adults.

The ill child typically has a \"slapped-cheek\" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a \"cold\" a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days.\n\nWhat causes fifth disease?\n\nFifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Pet dogs or cats may be immunized against \"parvovirus,\" but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. Therefore, a child cannot \"catch\" parvovirus from a pet dog or cat, and a pet cat or dog cannot catch human parvovirus B19 from an ill child.\n\nCan adults get fifth disease?\n\nYes, they can. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease.\n\nIs fifth disease contagious?\n\nYes. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash.\n\nHow does someone get infected with parvovirus B19?\n\nParvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to \"just have a cold.\" The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. In a household, as many as 50% of susceptible persons exposed to a family member who has fifth disease may become infected. During school outbreaks, 10% to 60% of students may get fifth disease.\n\nHow soon after infection with parvovirus B19 does a person become ill?\n\nA susceptible person usually becomes ill 4 to 14 days after being infected with the virus, but may become ill for as long as 20 days after infection.\n\nDoes everyone who is infected with parvovirus B19 become ill?\n\nNo. During outbreaks of fifth disease, about 20% of adults and children who are infected with parvovirus B19 do not develop any symptoms. Furthermore, other persons infected with the virus will have a non-specific illness that is not characteristic of fifth disease. Persons infected with the virus, however, do develop lasting immunity that protects them against infection in the future.\n\nHow is fifth disease diagnosed?\n\nA physician can often diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical examination. In cases in which it is important to confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to parvovirus B19 and other germs. If immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to parvovirus B19 is detected, the test result suggests that the person has had a recent infection.\n\nIs fifth disease serious?\n\nFifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy. Joint pain and swelling in adults usually resolve without long-term disability.\n\nParvovirus B19 infection may cause a serious"}, {"question": "What does the medical term \"code black\" mean?", "patient_answer": "It means \"bomb threat\".

The aim of reiki is to promote health, maintain well-being, and help people attain a higher consciousness.  Practitioners draw on \"reiki energy\" channeling it to areas of need in themselves and their patients.  They borrow terminology from physics, claiming that reiki acts at an atomic level, causing the body's molecules to vibrate with higher intensity and thus dissolving energy blockages that lead to disharmony and disease.  \n\nA treatment session lasts about an hour; the practitioner directs reike energy through his hands to the patient.  The patient lies clothed on a treatment table and the practitioner holds his hands on or over the body in 12 basic positions for about five minutes each.  This is said to balance the body's energy centers or \"chakras.\"  Some patients may feel relaxed after treatment; others feel invigorated.\"\n\nTo get in touch with your own energy body as a beginner, I recommend T'ai Chi.

There remain significant differences in life expectancy between men and women in the US and other developed countries, with women outliving men.

Eventually, after trying every day, you will be able to do one.  And then 2, 3, and slowly you work your way to like 25.  You only need to do about 15 to 20 per day to keep that 6 pack after its there.  You lay flat on the floor on your stomach.  Then you prop your feet up in push up position.  Now you put your hands out there on the floor.  Now put them together so that they are just touching.  Now, try to do a push up.  Keep your back as straight as possible.  When you first do this, your back will have a tendency to bend because you are trying to do at least one.  Hehe.  Um, I used to be able to do 50 of these easy.  After I get it, it was a cinch.  It will take you like 1 to 2 minutes a day trying to do like 20.  Thats all it takes to keep your 6 pack.  I used to do crunches.  Elbows to knees.  They arent bad, but this is far better.  Because doing crunches, you might not be able to sit on the floor with your legs out, and lift your body with your two hands without touching the floor.  With these push ups, after you get the hang of it, you can lift yourself off the ground, with your legs parallel to the ground.  This is when you know that you are on your way.

In most countries, women must see a general practitioner first. If their condition requires knowledge or equipment unavailable to the GP, they are referred to a gynaecologist. However, in the United States, law and many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care, and some women select that option.\n\nAs in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history and examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, and that it involves special equipment -- the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus and ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. Virgins are not usually examined vaginally. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigations\nSome of the investigations used in gynaecology are:\n\nabdominal ultrasound, to give a low-power view of the pelvic organs. \nvaginal ultrasound. A probe is passed into the vagina, which allows a detailed view of the uterus and its contents. \nblood tests. Levels of hormones such as estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and progesterone are measured, as well as prolactin. \nhysteroscopy -- a fine tube is passed into the uterus via the cervix under a general anaesthetic. \nlaparoscopy -- tubes are passed into the peritoneal cavity, which is then insufflated with carbon dioxide. This is commonly used to diagnose endometriosis. \nMRI and CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare.

Constant wetting and drying sucks the moisture from lips' outer layer, causing them to feel dry, which prompts more licking, creating a vicious cycle. Dehydrated lips are also more susceptible to dry, windy conditions. \n-- A moisturizing lip balm, especially those containing dimethicone, will help retain natural moisture and protect dry, chapped lips. \n-- Drinking lots of water will help prevent dehydration, which may contribute to chapped lips and dry skin. \n-- Smoothing a generous coating of lip balm on lips before bed will help to moisturize lips while you sleep. \n-- The sun's UV rays are responsible for 90 percent of visible damage we commonly attribute to aging. A lip balm that contains a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 will help prevent sunburn during outdoor activities, and may reduce the risks of skin aging, skin cancer, and other harmful effects of the sun. \n-- Regular lipstick products, especially some long-wearing varieties, may feel drying. A base coat of lip balm will add needed moisture during winter months. \n-- If lips become chapped, avoid wearing lipsticks while lips are recovering as drying products in color pigments may irritate chapped lips.

Delve into your daily fluid needs to learn how your body uses water and what factors may increase — or decrease — your water requirements.\n\nLack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry on normal functions. Even mild dehydration — as little as a 1 percent to 2 percent loss of your body weight — can sap your energy and make you tired. Dehydration poses a particular health risk for the very young and the very old. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include:\n\nExcessive thirst \nFatigue \nHeadache \nDry mouth \nLittle or no urination \nMuscle weakness \nDizziness \nLightheadedness \n\nEvery day you lose water through sweating — noticeable and unnoticeable — exhaling, urinating and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you need to replace this water by consuming beverages and foods that contain water. So how much water, or more precisely fluid, do you need?\n\nThis isn't an easy question to answer. A healthy adult's daily fluid intake can vary widely. Most people drink fluid to quench thirst, to supply perceived water needs and \"out of habit.\" At least three approaches estimate total fluid (water) needs for healthy, sedentary adults living in a temperate climate.\n\nReplacement approach. The average urine output for adults is 1.5 liters a day. You lose close to an additional liter of water a day through breathing, sweating and bowel movements. Food usually accounts for 20 percent of your fluid intake, so you if you consume 2 liters of water or other beverages a day (a little more than 8 cups), along with your normal diet, you can replace the lost fluids. \nEight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Another approach to water intake is the \"8 x 8 rule\" — drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day (about 1.9 liters). The rule could also be stated, \"drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day,\" as all fluids count toward the daily total. Though this approach isn't supported by scientific evidence, many people use this basic rule as a guideline for how much water and other fluids to drink. \nDietary recommendations. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day and women consume 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages a day. These guidelines are based on national food surveys that assessed people's average fluid intakes.", "doctor_answer": "I have to disagree with most of the people I guess.

However everyone responds differently to herpes in the initial infection phase, and some people never break out (about 25%), and many only have very mild symptoms, yet they are contagious (called asymptomatic viral shedding).  So even if you don't see an outbreak, that doesn't mean you don't have herpes.  If you had contact with someone who you think might have had herpes, you should get tested as soon as you do see any kind of lesion, where they can sample the fluid directly and test it for herpes virus.

In the first case, foodstuffs are broken down by enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria in order for the energy in them to be made available to the body. Through the processes of digestion and fermentation, gases can be liberated from what's eaten. In the second case, air that a person swallows from eating, drinking, breathing, chewing gum, and being stressed, among other ways of entry, that's not expelled during a burp travels through the stomach and intestine, transforming into fart-ready mode. In either case, the gases flow down through the rest of the digestive tract and eventually exit the body - Poof! Ping! Pfft! Toot-toot! Kaboom! - expelled as a fart, or farts. And this silent or noisy expulsion of air can help bring about some relief and comfort from a buildup of gas within the lower part of the body.\"", "doctor_answer": "What exactly is a fart? The word \"fart\" can stand for: Frequency Actuated Rectal Tremor. Farting, also known as flatulence, is the act of passing intestinal gas from the butt.

However in this new research, Professor Roger Thornley in England states, “We have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme DHFR or dihydrofolate which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs. This is the first time to our knowledge a known target for an anti-cancer drug has been identified as being inhibited by EGCG.” The scientist continued by saying that EGCG is probably just one of a number of anti-cancer mechanisms in green tea.\n\nIt's also said to help reduce bad Cholestrol among many other help benefits which are still being researched. You will find several books and online claims about green tea - most of them are true but not all of them have been published in scientific journals yet because enough research has not been done yet.\n\nIn short - it's good for you!", "doctor_answer": "as oppossed to coffee, green tea has an alkalizing affect on the body whereas coffee is acidic. our typical diet is all ready too acidic. \njust about anything green/fruits/vegetables  helps us this way.

Among various mycotoxins, aflatoxins have assumed significance due to their deleterious effects on human beings, poultry and livestock. The aflatoxin problem was first recognized in 1960, when there was severe outbreak of a disease referred as \"Turkey 'X' Disease\" in UK, in which over 100,000 turkey poults were died. The cause of the disease was shown due to toxins in peanut meal infected with Aspergillus flavus and the toxins were named as aflatoxins.\n\nNatural occurrence:\n\nFood products contaminated with aflatoxins include cereal (maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, wheat), oilseeds (groundnut, soybean, sunflower, cotton), spices (chillies, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, zinger), tree nuts (almonds, pistachio, walnuts, coconut) and milk. \n\nPhysical and chemical properties:\n\nAflatoxins are potent toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunosuppressive agents, produced as secondary metabolites by the fungus Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus on variety of food products. Among 18 different types of aflatoxins identified, major members are aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is normally predominant in amount in cultures as well as in food products. Pure AFB1 is pale-white to yellow crystalline, odorless solid. Aflatoxins are soluble in methanol, chloroform, actone, acetonitrile. A. flavus typically produces AFB1 and AFB2, where as A. parasiticus produce AFG1 and AFG2 as well as AFB1 and AFB2. Four other aflatoxins M1, M2, B2A, G2A which may be produced in minor amounts were subsequently isolated from cultures of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A number of closely related compounds namely aflatoxin GM1, parasiticol and aflatoxicol are also produced by A. flavus. Aflatoxin M1and M2 are major metabolites of aflatoxin B1 and B2 respectively, found in milk of animals that have consumed feed contaminated with aflatoxins.", "doctor_answer": "Aflatoxins are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus; but most notably Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic to animals, including humans.

The disorder most commonly begins between ages 20 and 40, but can strike at any age.\n\nThe exact cause is not known, but MS is believed to result from damage to the myelin sheath, the protective material which surrounds nerve cells. It is a progressive disease, meaning the damage gets worse over time. Inflammation destroys the myelin, leaving multiple areas of scar tissue (sclerosis). The inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system.\n\nThe inflammation causes nerve impulses to slow down or become blocked, leading to the symptoms of MS. Repeated episodes, or flare ups, of inflammation can occur along any area of the brain and spinal cord.\n\nSymptoms vary because the location and extent of each attack varies. Usually episodes that last days, weeks, or months alternate with times of reduced or no symptoms (remission).\n\nRecurrence (relapse) is common although non-stop progression without periods of remission may also occur.\n\nResearchers are not sure what triggers an attack. Patients with MS typically have a higher number of immune cells than a healthy person, which suggests that an immune response might play a role. The most common theories point to a virus or genetic defect, or a combination of both. There also appears to be a genetic link to the disease. MS is more likely to occur in northern Europe, the northern United States, southern Australia, and New Zealand than in other areas. Geographic studies indicate there may be an environmental factor involved.\n\nPeople with a family history of MS and those who live in a geographical area with a higher incidence rate for MS have a higher risk of the disease.\n\nCheck out this article with excellent illustrations:\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000737.htm", "doctor_answer": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the Central Nervous System (CNS) - that's the brain and spinal cord.

Thirst is often associated with a dry unpleasant-tasting mouth and the feeling of a need to obtain water; it can result from dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, pharmacologic agents, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids. Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid. Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers. Although nurses are commonly confronted with client complaints of thirst, there has been minimal nursing research that relates to assessment of thirst and drinking behaviors, nursing diagnoses for thirst, or nursing interventions for persons with altered thirst or drinking behaviors.\n\nThirst is the sensation indicating the body's need for water. Dry or salty food and dry, dusty air may induce such a sensation by depleting moisture in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Relief through ingestion of water is only temporary, however, if thirst results from a generalized depletion of water in the system. About three fourths of the body is composed of fluids, and the average adult requires 21/2 qt (2.4 liters) of fluid per day, supplied by water, other beverages, and foods. Depriving the body of water interferes with its metabolism and functions, causing dehydration, which is eventually fatal. The unnatural thirst that accompanies fever, diabetes, and other disorders is caused by a rapid reduction of the body fluids. The sensation of thirst is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus in the brain. Dehydration of the cells triggers the posterior pituitary to releast the antidiuretic hormone (ADH).", "doctor_answer": "To put it simply, you loose water, it concentrates your blood and your brain detects this concentration (osmolality) and sends a signal to drink and to also limit excretion of water.

Your symptoms, like night sweats, irregular periods, vaginal dryness, and menopause insomnia, are just indicators of underlying hormonal imbalances or metabolic damage from poor nutrition, stress and other factors.\n\nMenopause:\n    * Irregular periods. Your menstrual periods may stop suddenly, or gradually get lighter or heavier and then stop. The unpredictability of your periods may be your first clue that menopause is approaching.\n    * Decreased fertility. When ovulation begins to fluctuate, you're less likely to become pregnant. Until you haven't had a period for a year, however, pregnancy is still possible.\n    * Vaginal and urinary changes. As your estrogen level declines, the tissues lining your vagina and urethra — the opening to your bladder — become drier, thinner and less elastic. With decreased lubrication you may experience burning or itching, along with increased risk of infections of your urinary tract or vagina. These changes may make sexual intercourse uncomfortable or even painful. You may feel the need to urinate more frequently or more urgently, and you may experience urinary incontinence.\n    * Hot flashes. As your estrogen level drops, your blood vessels may expand rapidly, causing your skin temperature to rise. This can lead to a feeling of warmth that moves upward from your chest to your shoulders, neck and head. You may sweat, and as the sweat evaporates from your skin, you may feel chilled, weak and slightly faint. Your face might look flushed, and red blotches may appear on your chest, neck and arms. Most hot flashes last from 30 seconds to several minutes, although they can last much longer. The frequency, as well as the duration, of hot flashes varies from person to person. You may have them once every hour or only occasionally. They can occur any time during the day or night. They may be a part of your life for a year or more, or you may never have them.\n    * Sleep disturbances and night sweats. Night sweats are often a consequence of hot flashes. You may awaken from a sound sleep with soaking night sweats followed by chills. You may have difficulty falling back to sleep or achieving a deep, restful sleep. Lack of sleep may affect your mood and overall health.\n    * Changes in appearance. Many women gain a modest amount of weight — about 5 pounds on average — during the menopausal transition. The fat that once was concentrated in your hips and thighs may settle above your waist and in your abdomen. You may notice a loss of fullness in your breasts, thinning hair and wrinkles in your skin. If you previously experienced adult acne, it may become worse. Although your estrogen level drops, your body continues to produce small amounts of the male hormone testosterone. As a result, you may develop coarse hair on your chin, upper lip, chest and abdomen.\n    * Emotional and cognitive changes. You may experience irritability, fatigue, decreased memory and diminished concentration as you approach menopause. These symptoms have sometimes been attributed to hormonal fluctuations. Yet other factors are more likely to contribute to these changes, including sleep deprivation and stressful life events — such as the illness or death of a parent, grown children leaving home or returning home, and retirement.", "doctor_answer": "all the men  stop and stare at you"}, {"question": "How do you sleep on your side without your bottom arm falling asleep?", "patient_answer": "Soundly... then in sleep the body adapts to the most comfortable.", "doctor_answer": "You can't."}, {"question": "What is the best way to fight off the flu without a shot?", "patient_answer": "Wash your hands before you eat anything, or better yet use an antibacterial that you can keep in your purse, or if you're a guy in your pocket, don't put your fingers in your mouth (i.e., bite your nails).

Depending on several factors, your health care professional may prescribe azithromycin, in which case you will take only a single dose, or you may be prescribed doxycycline, which requires one pill twice a day for seven days. This may be followed by a test to see if you are cured, but test of cure is not routine and is usually reserved for pregnant women or individuals with persisting or new symptoms. Penicillin is not considered as effective against chlamydia as azithromycin. \n\nIf you are pregnant and infected with chlamydia, you still can be treated without harming the fetus. However, doxycycline is not recommended for pregnant women. The recommended regimen for pregnant women is erythromycin or amoxicillin for seven days, yet azithromycin as a single dose is also a possible option and recent studies and expert opinions suggest it is safe and effective. As with any antibiotic treatment, it is important that you take all your pills, even after symptoms disappear. \n\nBecause treatment with doxycycline or azithromycin is highly effective, women usually do not need retesting for chlamydia after treatment unless their symptoms persist or reinfection is suspected. Too often, women become reinfected because their partner has not been treated as well. Studies have shown that women who are reinfected with chlamydia have a much greater risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Therefore, it is important that you abstain from sexual contact until your partner has been tested and completed treatment, meaning seven days after a single-dose azithromycin regimen or after completion of a seven-day doxycycline regimen. \n\nIn general, treatment is recommended for any partner or partners you had sexual contact with up to 60 days prior to having symptoms or a diagnosis of chlamydia. Some clinics are experimenting with what is called partner-delivered therapy. Patients are given a one-gram dose of azithromycin to give to their partner. There are legal and ethical debates about this approach but in some cases it may be the most effective way to stop the spread of chlamydia, because many infected male partners have no symptoms and are reluctant to seek treatment. Penicillin is not considered as effective against chlamydia as azithromycin or doxycycline. \n\nPID treatment begins with an antibiotic regimen that provides broad coverage against several different bacteria. Treatment should begin as soon as a diagnosis is made, because immediate therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of long-term consequences of PID. Studies are under way to determine whether oral therapy is as effective as parenteral (intravenous) therapy. There are several different treatment options recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Regardless of which type of therapy is chosen, hospitalization is no longer recommended, except in certain circumstances including: \n\nsurgery is needed\n\nthe patient is pregnant\n\nan oral outpatient regimen cannot be tolerated\n\na patient does not respond clinically to oral antimicrobial therapy \n\na patient has severe illness, including high fever, nausea and vomiting\n\na patient has tubo-ovarian abscess or a weakened immune system\n\nWhile medication can stop PID, some women may need surgery to remove scar tissue and blockages caused by long-term infection.

This means that if a person is exposed to a cold virus but isn't necessarily showing symptoms, exposure to cold temperature doesn't make a difference as to whether this person gets sick or how sick this person will become. \n\nStill, most colds occur during the fall and winter months, when schools begin to open and the mercury begins to fall. While cold temperatures do not cause colds, the colder months of the year seem to be more conducive to infection or transmission. This is probably due to many factors, including: \n\n>lower humidity \n>schools are in session \n>people spend more time indoors and in closer quarters \n>The cold season corresponds to the colder months of the year, which are also those with lower humidity. This absence of moisture may affect the number of infections as the most common cold-causing viruses thrive in lower humidity. What's more, dry air can dry the mucous lining of the nasal passages, making it more open to viral infection.\"", "doctor_answer": "Going out into the cold weather has no effect on the spread of a cold. The reason that there appears to be a relationship is that people spend more time indoors during the cold winter weather.

We now know that it is caused by the human parvo virus B19-3. It is called Fifth's disease after four more common viral rash illnesses seen in children which are measles, scarlet fever, rubella and scarlatina. The Sixth's disease is roseola. Fifth's disease virus, or human parvo virus B19, is attracted to rapidly dividing cells in the body. Therefore people with weak immune systems and with weak red blood cells are at high risk. This includes people with sickle cell disease, hereditary spirochaetosis, any serious immune disease or cancer, and AIDS. It also might include someone with recurrent blood loss and anemia. In these patients, a very severe with profound anemia and a very severe disease without the typical rash. These patients obviously need the care of an experienced physician and frequently a hematologist.\n\nFor the majority of patients, however, Fifths disease is a mild viral infection which starts with typical cold\n\nlike symptoms in adults and sometimes vague muscle aches and headache. This is the time in which the patient is actually contagious and the virus is multiplying in the body. After a few days, the virus clears and antibodies to the virus cause a classic rash in the skin. In adults, there is usually some joint swelling and tenderness. In children the rash is a slightly raised, bright red patch over the facial cheeks with some clearing directly around the mouth. Also present is a lacy pink to red rash scattered over the extremities and trunk. Usually palms and soles are spared. About 50% of the time, the rash itches. The rash seems to fade and come back whenever the child is stressed or exposed to a lot of sun or overheating. In older adolescents and adults, the rash may not appear as the typical rash seen in children.\n\nThe predominant symptoms seen in up to 60% of adults is joint swelling usually the wrist, hands or ankles. This may last for up to a few weeks but does not cause any permanent changes and does not cause rheumatoid arthritis. The joint symptoms are only found in about 3% of children up to age nine. Again, most children will acquire Fifth's disease at some time in their life and most adults, when tested for antibodies show evidence of having had it sometime in their life. The risk to a pregnant woman is considered about .6% and should be taken into account since a growing fetus does have both a weak immune system and rapidly dividing red cells and is, therefore, susceptible to the virus. It is not recommended that children with Fifth's disease be excluded from school because by the time the rash appears, they are actually not contagious. It is also not recommended that pregnant women be excluded from day care or other work situations because of the relative low risk to them. They should be aware, however, of any epidemics taking place and use good hand washing as a means of decreasing the spread of the virus. There is presently no vaccine but there is some experimental evidence that IV gamma globulin may help in high risk patients; however it is not presently recommended for routine patients. Infants of mothers who contract parvo virus B19 in early pregnancy are at risk for severe blood loss but do not develop birth defects. In cases where the diagnosis is picked up there have been fetal blood exchanges done and the infants have been saved through this procedure. Obviously this is something that would require a sophisticated medical center and a team of perinatologists and obstetrician.", "doctor_answer": "yes you can but only if your infected skin touches someone else's skin"}, {"question": "what is proteolytic enzyme tablets?", "patient_answer": "I assume you are talking about something like Pancrease which is a pill that contains the normal proteolytic enzymes that are released by your pancreas to aid in digestion.  They cleave bonds  in protein to make more simple molecules that your intestines can absorb and are usually prescribed for people that have inadequate pancreas function.", "doctor_answer": "Proteases (proteinases, peptidases or proteolytic enzymes) are enzymes that break peptide bonds between amino acids of proteins. The process is called proteolytic cleavage, a common mechanism of activation or inactivation of enzymes especially involved in blood coagulation or digestion. They use a molecule of water for this and are thus classified as hydrolases.\n\n\nClassification\nThere are currently six classes of proteases:\n\nSerine proteases \nThreonine proteases \nCysteine proteases \nAspartic acid proteases (e. g. plasmepsin) \nMetalloproteases \nGlutamic acid proteases \n\nThe threonine and glutamic peptidases were not described until 1995 and 2004, respectively. The mechanism used to cleave a peptide bond involves making an amino acid residue (serine, cystein and threonine peptidases) or a water molecule (aspartic, metallo and glutamic peptidases) nucleophilic so that it can attack the peptide carbonyl group. One way to make a nucleophile is by a catalytic triad, where a histidine residue is used to activate serine, cysteine or threonine as a nucleophile.\n\n\nOccurrence\nProteases occur naturally in all organisms and constitute 1-5% of the gene content. These enzymes are involved in a multitude of physiological reactions from simple digestion of food proteins to highly regulated cascades (e.g. the blood clotting cascade, the complement system and the invertebrate prophenoloxidase activating cascade). Peptidases can break either specific peptide bonds (limited proteolysis), depending on the amino acid sequence of a protein, or break down a complete peptide to amino acids (unlimited proteolysis). The activity can be a destructive change abolishing a protein's function or digesting it to its principal components, it can be an activation of a function or it can be a signal in a signalling pathway."}, {"question": "How do you get rid of herpes?", "patient_answer": "It is a virus infection.affects only on one side of the body.

Also, the general health and lifestyle of a person may be a major factor in treatment.  If a person has a chronic disease such as diabetes, or has allergies to certain antibiotics, or has cancer, a series of different treatments for their chronic disease may be needed over time, or if a secondary disease to the chronic disease is a problem, may need a different treatment than a healthy person would need.

If levels of a particular vitamin are inadequate, a deficiency disease results.\n\nVitamin A helps in the formation and maintenance of healthy teeth, skeletal and soft tissue, mucous membranes, and skin. It is also known as retinol because it generates the pigments that are necessary for the working of the retina. It promotes good vision, especially in dim light. Vitamin A may also be required for reproduction and breast-feeding. Beta-carotene is a precursor to vitamin A that has antioxidant properties, helping the body deal with unstable chemicals called free radicals.\n\nThiamine (B-1) helps the body cells convert carbohydrates into energy. It is also essential for the functioning of the heart and for healthy nerve cells, including those in the brain.\n\nRiboflavin (B-2) works with the other B vitamins and is important for body growth and red blood cell production. Similar to thiamine, it helps in releasing energy from carbohydrates.\n\nNiacin is a B vitamin that helps maintain healthy skin and nerves. It is also important for the conversion of food to energy and may have cholesterol-lowering effects.\n\nVitamin B-6 is also known as pyridoxine. The more protein a person eats, the more vitamin B-6 is required to help the body use the protein. It aids in the formation of red blood cells and in the maintenance of normal brain function. It also assists in the synthesizing of antibodies in the immune system.\n\nVitamin B-12, like the other B vitamins, is important for metabolism. It, too, helps in the formation of red blood cells and in the maintenance of the central nervous system.\n\nPantothenic acid is essential for the metabolism of food. It is also essential in the synthesis of hormones and cholesterol. Biotin is essential for the metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates, and in the synthesis of hormones and cholesterol. Cholesterol is needed for the functioning of cell membranes, particularly in the brain.\n\nFolate (folic acid) works with vitamin B-12 in the production of red blood cells. It is necessary for the synthesis of DNA, which controls heredity as well as tissue growth and cell function. Any woman who may become pregnant should be sure to consume enough folate -- low levels of this substance are associated with devastating birth defects such as spina bifida. Many foods are now fortified with folic acid to help reduce the level of such birth defects.\n\nVitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, promotes healthy teeth and gums, helps in the absorption of iron, and helps maintain normal connective tissue. It also promotes wound healing and is an antioxidant.\n\nVitamin D is also known as the \"sunshine vitamin,\" since it is manufactured by the body after being exposed to sunshine. Ten to 15 minutes of sunshine three times per week is adequate to produce the body's requirement of vitamin D. This vitamin promotes the body's absorption of calcium, which is essential for the normal development and maintenance of healthy teeth and bones. It also helps maintain adequate blood levels of calcium and phosphorus, which are minerals necessary for many functions.\n\nVitamin E is also known as tocopherol and is an antioxidant. It is also important in the formation of red blood cells and the use of vitamin K.\n\nVitamin K is known as the clotting vitamin, because without it blood would not coagulate. Some studies indicate that it helps in maintaining strong bones in the elderly.", "doctor_answer": "our body needs vitamins because they help our cells produce the needed energy...a vitamin deficiency is a very serious problem but gettin too much of them is pretty bad as well..."}, {"question": "how to get pregnant?", "patient_answer": "have sex or artificial incimination", "doctor_answer": "Get a male to stick their penis in your vagina."}, {"question": "If a person had their first and only M.S.

Laughter can be exhilarating, cathartic, embarrassing, debilitating, punitive, liberating, grotesque, or helpless. This course is designed to explore the universal (we believe) human phenomenon of laughter from a number of different perspectives, not all of them areas of expertise of the instructor. We will be interested in such questions as: How do we laugh? Why do we laugh? What makes us laugh? What physiological, psychological, social, and political work does or might laughter do? Do other animals laugh? Do the gods laugh? How do artists and performers make us laugh? Are there kinds of laughter? Has laughter changed across time? Across space? Is laughter gendered? Is there a specifically Roman, Japanese, or Southern laughter? Is there anything that can’t or mustn’t be funny? What is the opposite of laughter? The course will involve a series of readings and discussions—but also a series of jokes, stories, excursions, interviews, and performances.

After you eat fish or other foods that are contaminated with methylmercury, the methylmercury enters your bloodstream easily and goes rapidly to other parts of your body.\n\nOnly small amounts of methylmercury enter the bloodstream directly through the skin, but other forms of organic mercury (in particular dimethylmercury) can rapidly enter the body through the skin. Organic mercury compounds may evaporate slowly at room temperature and may enter your body easily if you breathe in the vapors.\n\nOnce organic mercury is in the bloodstream, it moves easily to most tissues and readily enters the brain. Methylmercury that is in the blood of a pregnant woman will easily move into the blood of the developing child and then into the child's brain and other tissues.\n\nLike metallic mercury, methylmercury can be changed by your body to inorganic mercury. When this happens in the brain, the mercury can remain there for a long time.\n\nWhen methylmercury does leave your body after you have been exposed, it leaves slowly over a period of several months, mostly as inorganic mercury in the feces.

Any prevention?", "patient_answer": "Ovarian cysts form for numerous reasons. The most common type is a follicular cyst, which results from the growth of a follicle. A follicle is the normal fluid-filled sac that contains an egg. Follicular cysts form when the follicle grows larger than normal during the menstrual cycle and does not open to release the egg. Usually, follicular cysts resolve on their own over the course of days to months. Cysts can contain blood (hemorrhagic or endometrioid cysts) from injury or leakage of tiny blood vessels into the egg sac. If a woman is in her 40's, or younger, and has regular menstrual periods, most ovarian masses are \"functioning ovarian cysts,\" which are not really abnormal. They are related to the process of ovulation that happens with the menstrual cycle. They usually disappear on their own during a future menstrual cycle. Therefore, especially in women in their 20's and 30's, these cysts are watched for a few menstrual cycles to verify that they disappear. Because oral contraceptives work in part by preventing ovulation, physicians will not really expect women who are taking oral contraceptives to have common \"functioning ovarian cysts.\" Thus, women who develop ovarian cysts while taking oral contraceptives may be advised against simple observation; rather, they may receive closer monitoring with pelvic ultrasound or, less commonly, surgical exploration of the ovary. Functional ovarian cysts cannot be prevented if you are ovulating. Anything that makes ovulation less frequent reduces your chance of developing an ovarian cyst. Birth control pills, pregnancy, and breast-feeding in the first 6 months following birth prevent ovulation. Ovulation ceases when menopause is complete. Women who use high-dose birth control pills have a modestly decreased risk of developing functional ovarian cysts; low-dose birth control pills seem to have a less preventive effect.", "doctor_answer": "It depends on how big the cyst is and depends on the doctors.  If you have one, it normally is not a big deal.  Many females deal with PCOS which is poly-cystic ovary syndrome.  Which means when a female has this they have many different cysts that cover the ovaries. And this females live perfectly normal lives for the most part.

Psychiatry defines these traits as a \"mental illness\", and promotes it as a \"disease\" that requires \"treatment\".\n\nIt is not a \"disease\", despite claims made in certain peoples answers here. There is NO credible scientific evidence that shows the existence of what constitutes \"schizo-affecive disorder\", \"schizophrenia\" or ANY mental illness, as a genetic, biological/neurological disorder, brain abnormality or \"chemical imbalance\".\n\n\"For a disease to exist there must be a tangible, objective physical abnormality that can be determined by a test such as, but not limited to, blood or urine test, X-Ray, brain scan or biopsy. All reputable doctors would agree: No physical abnormality, no disease. In psychiatry, no test or brain scan exists to prove that a 'mental disorder' is a physical disease. Disingenuous comparisons between physical and mental illness and medicine are simply part of psychiatry's orchestrated but fraudulent public relations and marketing campaign.\" Fred A. Baughman Jr., MD (Neurologist, Pediatric Neurology), & Fellow at the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n\"Chemical imbalance…it’s a shorthand term really, it’s probably drug industry derived… We don’t have tests because to do it, you’d probably have to take a chunk of brain out of someone - not a good idea.\" Dr. Mark Graff, Chair of the Committee of Public Affairs for the American Psychiatric Association. July, 2005.\n\nSymptoms that psychiatry labels as \"schizo-affective disorder\" (or it's related disorders), can stem from any number of variable sources. Many people have overcome disorders such as \"bipolar\" and \"schizo affective disorder\" through effective megavitamin therapy and effective nutrition. A growing wealth of evidence supports that underlying nutritional deficiencies can cause even the most severe mental disorders, including \"schizophrenia\". [1,2,3,4,5,6] \n\nYou may also be interested to know that the work undertaken by pioneers such as Dr. Lars Martensson and the late Dr. Loren Mosher show that there is also another way - far safer and more effective than psychiatric restraint, drugs and electro-shocks. For over a decade Loren R Mosher, MD, held a central position in American psychiatric research. He was the first Chief of the Center for Studies of Schizophrenia at the National Institute of Mental Health, 1969-1980. He founded the Schizophrenia Bulletin and for ten years he was its Editor-in-Chief. He also led the Soteria Project, which demonstrated that effective rehabilitation is possible without harmful antipsychotic drugs. Soteria provided a safe and sane environment where schizophrenic patients could stay, medication-free, with a young, nonprofessional staff trained to listen to and understand them and provide companionship. The idea was that schizophrenia or related disorders can often be overcome with the help of meaningful relationships, rather than with drugs, and that such treatment would eventually lead to unquestionably healthier lives. The results were fantastic. Over just 6 weeks, patients recovered as quickly as those treated with medication in hospitals. [7,8] \n\nBottom line? Psychiatry is a belief-system, a \"faith\", not a science. Despite the huge marketing strategies, the so-called \"research\" and all the propaganda thrown at the world, there is not one iota of scientific evidence that proves that \"schizophrenia\" or ANY mental illness, in fact, exists as an actual --medical disease--.\n\nIf you have been told differently then know this: You have been lied to.\n\nFor more information, please visit:\n\nhttp://groups.msn.com/psychbusters\nDecoding Psychiatric Propaganda", "doctor_answer": "http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?Section=By_Illness&template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=11837\n\ni hope this helps, its a very reputable sight."}, {"question": "What's a \"compounding pharmacy\"?", "patient_answer": "They actually mix liquids, powders and other drugs to create a specific compound for the patient.

But here's more information.\n\nWhat is Creatine?\n\nCreatine is a nutrient naturally found in all our bodies. It is a combination of 3 amino acids; arginine, glycine and methionine. Creatine helps provide the energy our muscles need to move, particularly quick and explosive movements. Muscle contraction is initially fuelled by ATP (adenosine-triphosphate ).\n\nIs Creatine Safe?\n\nYes, Creatine is a natural amino acid present in the body of humans and animals. The human body has 100-115 grams of creatine in the form of creatine phosphate. No negative side effects have been noted in the research with the recommended levels of supplementation.\n\nAre there any noted side effects?\n\nCreatine is so efficient at shuttling water into the intramuscular compartment, that an emergent side effect associated with it is that of muscle cramping. This most often occurs when too little fluid is consumed whilst supplementing with creatine. Muscle Cramping, strains and tears are all anecdotal evidence that are not supported by scientific fact.\n\nThis supplement has over 100 peer reviewed published studies.  It's well researched and the safety in the short term and long term is well known.\n\nPersonally I wouldn't recommend this supplement to teenagers but that is my own opinion, not based on facts supporting any side effects in teenage use.", "doctor_answer": "I have never read any negative side effects of creatine beyond headaches and loose stool.  Most reports I have read state that it's actually beneficial for your body, possibly even in the long run.

Then, ease back into the running -- 15 minutes of running; 15 minutes of walking. Gradually build back up to where you were before.

Topical medications include terbinafine (Lamisil) and ciclopirox (Penlac). \nRemoval of an infected nail is used for severe or recurring fungal nail infections. Combining nail removal with antifungal creams or pills is likely to be more effective than using one of these treatments alone.

Although false positive and false negative results do not occur very often, they can cause anxiety and can affect a woman’s health.\n\nA false positive Pap test means that a patient is told she has abnormal cells, but the cells are actually normal. A false negative Pap test occurs when a specimen is called normal, but the woman has a significant abnormality that was missed. A false negative Pap test may delay the diagnosis and treatment of a precancerous condition. However, regular screening helps to compensate for the false negative result. If abnormal cells are missed at one time, chances are good that the cells will be detected the next time.\n\nWhat methods are being developed to improve the accuracy of Pap tests? \nIn April 1996, the Consensus Development Conference on Cervical Cancer, which was convened by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), concluded that about half of false negative Pap tests are due to inadequate specimen collection. The other half are due to a failure to identify or interpret the specimens correctly. Although the conventional Pap test is effective in the majority of cases, the conference made it clear that new methods of collecting and reading specimens are needed to reduce the number of false negatives.\n\nThe Bethesda System requires laboratories to determine whether there are enough cervical cells in the specimen to make a proper evaluation. This requirement helps improve the quality of samples and sample collection. The Bethesda System requires a sample to be categorized as “satisfactory for evaluation” or “unsatisfactory for evaluation.”\n\nOne new method of collecting and analyzing samples is called liquid-based thin-layer slide preparation. This method may make it easier to screen for abnormal cells. Cervical cells are collected with a brush or other collection instrument. The instrument is rinsed in a vial of liquid preservative. The vial is sent to a laboratory, where an automated thin-layer slide device prepares the slide for viewing. Results of this method suggest that it is comparable to, or more sensitive than, standard Pap tests for the detection of significant abnormalities.\n\nComputer automated readers are also being used to improve the reading of Pap tests. This technology uses a microscope that conveys a cellular image to a computer, which analyzes the image for the presence of abnormal cells.", "doctor_answer": "I would think as with any tests done it could happen.

Under low oxygen tension, HbS aggregate (polymerizes in rod shaped form), distorting the  shape of the RBC to sickle shape.  This misshapen RBC is unable to squeeze through capillaries causing vascular occlusion and consequently local hypoxia or hemolysis.\n\nBecause sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive condition, in order for a child to get it, they can inherit it from either one or both of their parents, and in the former case, they will be a carrier and will exhibit sickle cell trait (e.g., only some blood cells are sickled).  In the latter case, all their RBCs will be sickled.  In places such as Africa where Malaria (plasmodium falciparum) is quite prevalent, sickle cell trait provides a selective advantage for carriers.\n\nSome common symptoms are:\nAnemia (Hb level 6-10 g/dL)\nFailure to thrive\nSplenomegaly\nRepeated infection\nPainful swelling of hands or feet (from occlusion of capillaries) \nInfection major cause of death", "doctor_answer": "Sickle cell anemia is an inability of red blood cells to properly carry oxygen due to a change in the genetic code.

The word stress means different things to different people. Some people define stress as events or situations that cause them to feel tension, pressure, or negative emotions such as anxiety and anger. Others view stress as the response to these situations. This response includes physiological changes—such as increased heart rate and muscle tension—as well as emotional and behavioral changes. However, most psychologists regard stress as a process involving a person’s interpretation and response to a threatening event.\n\nStress is a common experience. We may feel stress when we are very busy, have important deadlines to meet, or have too little time to finish all of our tasks. Often people experience stress because of problems at work or in social relationships, such as a poor evaluation by a supervisor or an argument with a friend. Some people may be particularly vulnerable to stress in situations involving the threat of failure or personal humiliation. Others have extreme fears of objects or things associated with physical threats—such as snakes, illness, storms, or flying in an airplane—and become stressed when they encounter or think about these perceived threats. Major life events, such as the death of a loved one, can cause severe stress.\nStress can have both positive and negative effects. Stress is a normal, adaptive reaction to threat. It signals danger and prepares us to take defensive action. Fear of things that pose realistic threats motivates us to deal with them or avoid them. Stress also motivates us to achieve and fuels creativity. Although stress may hinder performance on difficult tasks, moderate stress seems to improve motivation and performance on less complex tasks. In personal relationships, stress often leads to less cooperation and more aggression. \n\nIf not managed appropriately, stress can lead to serious problems. Exposure to chronic stress can contribute to both physical illnesses, such as heart disease, and mental illnesses, such as anxiety disorders. The field of health psychology focuses in part on how stress affects bodily functioning and on how people can use stress management techniques to prevent or minimize disease.", "doctor_answer": "Stress is your body's early warning system.

It is characterized by sore throat, fever and a rash over the upper body that may spread to cover almost the entire body.\nSigns and Symptoms: Persons with scarlet fever have a characteristic rash that is fine, red, rough-textured and blanches upon pressure. Scarlet fever also produces a bright red tongue with \"strawberry\" appearance. The skin often \"desquamates,\" or peels, after recovery, usually on tips of fingers and toes.\n\nTransmission\nThe illness is spread by the same means as strep throat.\nTreatment\nOther than the occurrence of the rash, the treatment and course of scarlet fever are no different from those of any strep throat.\nChange in virulence\nRead any novel of the 18th century and Scarlet Fever often seems to be followed by many months in convalescence institutions. Most children now are ill for under a week. Whilst this is used as an example of the benefits of antibiotics, it is also true that the bacteria mutated in the early-mid 20th century into less virulent forms.

Paying attention to how you breathe probably does have the effect of making you more anxious and it would seem to keep you from going to sleep as quickly as you would if you weren't always monitoring your breathing. Monitoring your breathing keeps you alert rather than helping you relax and fall asleep.\n\nMy notion: you are too focused on how you breath. As long as you don't have mechanical difficulties breathing then it doesn't matter how you breathe. Work on not paying attention to this....", "doctor_answer": "When you breathe through only nose, more heat accumulates in your body. Breatheing through mouth dissapates heat.\n\nAnd there are more benefits of doing so. Its considered bad to breathe through mouth for some reasons.\n\nhttp://www.breathing.com/articles/nose-breathing.htm\n\nSo there is nothing to worry about for your problem. You are perfectly alright.\n\nOne more thing is that, even though we all are alike, but our overall ability of matabolism is a balance of this breathing and our other muscular factors and ofcourse number of times our hearts beat. For example, the Neanderthals used to have bigger and more open nose, so as to breathe rapidly and conserve heat.

Diabetes is also usually inherited. But you can also have the \"old age\" as they call it, diabetes, which my father had in his 60s.  That was caused by too much alcohol and too much rich food (and not exercising and in general, just taking care of yourself.)

Magnesium aids the muscles in using oxygen and when the level is low which is typical in Fibro it can cause are cramps, spasms, and pain.) \nAlso, Fibromyalgia is a neurotransmitter disorder certain foods can trigger similiar symptoms to Fibro.

Not definite, but it is always worth a try. Here is a good diet I would suggest:\n\n\nFirst of all, (very important) don't eat ANY type of meat . This includes any soups that have a beef/chicken stock as the base. So buy vegetarian vegetable soup...not just vegetable soup, and eat it for supper(Campbell's (don't buy generic brand..its bland). This also includes milk. No cow milk. Buy some Soy milk. I promise it is delicious..I use 8th continent original soymilk. And this is 100% healthier than cow milk. This will help you alot. \n(no butter for a week!!, no ranch dressing, no sour cream...nothing of the sort...and try to lay off of the cheese unless it is soy cheese) \n\nSecond of all, no candy bars, chocolates, donuts with frosting center, cakes, ice cream....just go 1 week without sweets  \nI usually eat oatmeal for breakfast, and I either cut up fresh peaches, strawberries or even canned peaches and I don't need any sugar. \nFor a good snack in between I drink a mug of hot lemon water with honey added to sweeten. \n(*when feeling hungry, drinking a mug/cup of anything warm will ease your hungry tummy*) \nFor snacks when craving sweets: eat almonds, peanuts, soynuts, raisins, ovaltine mixed with soymilk is ok on this detox diet, drink a big cup of orange juice, eat fresh fruit, apples, oranges, strawberries, etc. \nEat vegetables and rice. Can buy frozen packages of broccolli, cauliflower, carrots, and raw type as well for snacks. \nGot a blender? Make smoothies with your new fruit selections, a natural, detoxing milkshake. Just don't use yogurt(which is cow milk based), >>>but add some soymilk, orange juice, bananas and strawberries for a shake that is out of this world!!!! \nI have always used this as my way to start exercising again. \n\n(tip: Slim Fast products have always helped me too(even though the shakes are cow-milk based). They have a meal bar called \"fruit & nut bar\" that is great. If i wake up and want to go for a jog or exercise, I take about 2-3 bites (don't eat whole bar before exercising) and it helps me feel not-sluggish during my workout.) \n\nMajor tip: anyone over the age of 20 should be taking a daily vitamin.

It is possible to have more than one type of vaginal infection at the same time. For more information on the other types, see the topics Vaginal Yeast Infections and Trichomoniasis.\n\nWhat is bacterial vaginosis?\n\nBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a change in the balance of bacteria that are normally present in the vagina, which can cause bothersome symptoms. BV is the most common cause of vaginal symptoms in women of childbearing age. \n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nThe most notable symptom of bacterial vaginosis is an excessive, bad-smelling, grayish-white vaginal discharge. A \"fishy\" smell, which is usually worse after sex, is a telltale sign of BV. However, about half of women with BV have no noticeable symptoms. 1 \n\nWhat risks are related to bacterial vaginosis?\n\nBV is of particular concern when you are pregnant. During pregnancy, BV is linked to complications, such as miscarriage, early (preterm) delivery, and pelvic infection after childbirth. 2 Uterine infection is a common trigger of preterm labor—BV could lead to this type of infection or could be a red flag for another problem causing preterm labor. Experts continue to research whether BV is a direct or indirect cause.\n\nHaving BV at the time of an invasive pelvic procedure (such as a cesarean delivery, hysterectomy, clinical abortion, endometrial biopsy, or intrauterine device (IUD) placement) increases your risk of developing a pelvic infection.\n\nHaving BV at the time of exposure to a sexually transmitted disease (including HIV) increases your risk of becoming infected. 3 \n\nWhat causes bacterial vaginosis?\n\nThe cause of BV is poorly understood. However, a number of known risk factors can lead to a drop in \"good\" lactobacillus bacteria in the vagina and an increase in less friendly bacteria, whose growth is usually kept in check by higher levels of lactobacillus. These risk factors include sexual activity, history of sexually transmitted disease, douching, and tampon, diaphragm, and IUD use. BV is more common among women who have multiple sex partners or female sex partners. \n\nBV is sometimes linked to hormonal changes; it is more common around the time of menstruation and is found in up to 23% of pregnant women. 4 \n\nHow is bacterial vaginosis diagnosed?\n\nBacterial vaginosis is diagnosed based on your symptoms, a pelvic examination, and a microscope inspection of a sample of vaginal discharge. When low numbers of lactobacillus organisms and higher numbers of other bacteria are present under the microscope, BV is diagnosed. \n\nHow is it treated?\n\nBV goes away without treatment about 25% of the time, so treatment isn't always necessary. 3 You will likely be screened and treated for BV if you: \n\nAre planning an invasive pelvic procedure that could result in an infection. \nHave BV symptoms, especially while pregnant. \nAre pregnant and have a history of preterm delivery that may have been caused by infection. \nHave symptoms that aren't going away on their own. \nBV is typically treated with antibiotic medication. Metronidazole (Flagyl) is the first-choice treatment for BV. If you aren't pregnant, you can choose to take it by mouth (orally) or by inserting it into the vagina; pregnant women are only treated orally. \n\nAntibiotic treatment for BV can lead to vaginal yeast infections because the medications change the balance of organisms in the vagina, allowing an excess of yeast to grow. You may be able to prevent this by regularly eating yogurt with active Lactobacillus acidophilus culture or taking L. acidophilus dietary supplements. \n\nSome women have success with using oral or vaginal lactobacillus by itself to treat bacterial vaginosis. 5 \n\nBecause BV is not caused by sexually transmitted organisms, treating your", "doctor_answer": "I know it can be similar to an STD-as in it can be transferred between partners.  So they may require your partner to be treated as well…although you don’t have to have a partner to get vaginitis. The cause tends to be a change in pH levels due to hormone fluctuations, stress, yeast infection treatments, etc.\n\nThe gel isn't nearly as bad as the oral antibiotics.  There's a white discharge and there can be some burning.\n\nMany times after you finish with the gel you end up with a yeast infection.

Radio waves 10,000 to 30,000 times stronger than the magnetic field of the earth are then sent through the body. This affects the body's atoms, forcing the nuclei into a different position. As they move back into place they send out radio waves of their own. The scanner picks up these signals and a computer turns them into a picture. These pictures are based on the location and strength of the incoming signals. \n\nOur body consists mainly of water, and water contains hydrogen atoms. For this reason, the nucleus of the hydrogen atom is often used to create an MRI scan in the manner described above. \n\nWhat does an MRI scan show? \n\nUsing an MRI scanner, it is possible to make pictures of almost all the tissue in the body. The tissue that has the least hydrogen atoms (such as bones) turns out dark, while the tissue that has many hydrogen atoms (such as fatty tissue) looks much brighter. By changing the timing of the radiowave pulses it is possible to gain information about the different types of tissues that are present. \n\nAn MRI scan is also able to provide clear pictures of parts of the body that are surrounded by bone tissue, so the technique is useful when examining the brain and spinal cord. \n\nBecause the MRI scan gives very detailed pictures it is the best technique when it comes to finding tumours (benign or malignant abnormal growths) in the brain. If a tumour is present the scan can also be used to find out if it has spread into nearby brain tissue. \n\nThe technique also allows us to focus on other details in the brain. For example, it makes it possible to see the strands of abnormal tissue that occur if someone has multiple sclerosis and it is possible to see changes occurring when there is bleeding in the brain, or find out if the brain tissue has suffered lack of oxygen after a stroke. \n\nThe MRI scan is also able to show both the heart and the large blood vessels in the surrounding tissue. This makes it possible to detect heart defects that have been building up since birth, as well as changes in the thickness of the muscles around the heart following a heart attack. The method can also be used to examine the joints, spine and sometimes the soft parts of your body such as the liver, kidneys and spleen. \n\nHow does an MRI scan differ from a CT scan? \n\nWith an MRI scan it is possible to take pictures from almost every angle, whereas a CT scan only shows pictures horizontally. There is no ionizing radiation (X-rays) involved in producing an MRI scan. MRI scans are generally more detailed, too. The difference between normal and abnormal tissue is often clearer on the MRI scan than on the CT scan. \n\nHow is an MRI scan performed? \n\nThe scan is usually done as an outpatient procedure, which means that the patient can go home after the test. During the scan it is important to lie completely still. For this reason it might be necessary to give a child an anaesthetic before they are tested. \n\nSince you are exposed to a powerful magnetic field during the MRI scan, it is important not to wear jewellery or any other metal objects.\n\nIt is also important for the patient to inform medical staff if they use electrical appliances, such as a hearing aid or pacemaker, or have any metal in their body such as surgical clips, but orthopaedic metalware such as artificial hips or bone screws is not normally a problem. \n\nIs an MRI scan dangerous? \n\nThere are no known dangers or side effects connected to an MRI scan. The test is not painful; you cannot feel it. Since radiation is not used, the procedure can be repeated without problems.

Nothing.  I stopped eating anything that wasn't good for me. When I feel like something sweet, I put frozen strawberries in a blender, then add non-fat milk and blend until very smooth.

They include: \n\nBreathe moist air: Relief for a sinus headache can be achieved by humidifying the dry air environment. This can be done by using a steam vaporizer or cool-mist humidifier, steam from a basin of hot water, or steam from a hot shower. \n\nAlternate hot and cold compresses: Place a hot compress across your sinuses for three minutes, and then a cold compress for 30 seconds. Repeat this procedure three times per treatment, two to six times a day. \n\nNasal irrigation: Some believe that when nasal irrigation or rinse is performed, mucus, allergy creating particles and irritants such as pollens, dust particles, pollutants and bacteria are washed away, reducing the inflammation of the mucous membrane. Normal mucosa will fight infections and allergies better and will reduce the symptoms. Nasal irrigation helps shrink the sinus membranes and thus increases drainage. There are several over-the-counter nasal rinse products available. Consult your ear, nose, and throat specialist for directions on making a home nasal rinse or irrigation solution.\n\nOver-the-counter medications: Some over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are highly effective in reducing sinus headache pain. The primary ingredient in most OTC pain relievers is aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, or a combination of them. The best way to choose a pain reliever is by determining which of these ingredients works best for you.\n\nDecongestants: Sinus pressure headaches caused by allergies are usually treated with decongestants and antihistamines. In difficult cases, nasal steroid sprays may be recommended.\n\nAlternative medicine: Chinese herbalists use Magnolia Flower as a remedy for clogged sinus and nasal passages. In conjunction with other herbs, such as angelica, mint, and chrysanthemum, it is often recommended for upper respiratory tract infections and sinus headaches, although its effectiveness for these problems has not been scientifically confirmed.", "doctor_answer": "use steam inhalator to clear nose clog"}, {"question": "is there a yoga pose for depression?", "patient_answer": "Studies indicate that regular exercise too, including yoga asanas and breathing, can help some people ease the symptoms of mild to moderate forms of depression. \n\nOf course, one major hurdle in using exercise to alleviate depression is motivation, or lack of it.

I have depression, so I tried this website. Good luck", "doctor_answer": "I understand your desire to learn about depression and remedies for it. I have three things that have\ngotten me through times when I've been depressed, and\nthey're all gentle solutions that I think will suit an\nintelligent person like yourself. \n\n1 - The first is what Freud calls the \"talking cure\".\nHe insists that it must be performed by a\npsychoanalyst who you are paying for, but actually\nI've performed it by writing in a diary. The key is to\nbe very honest, and try to find connections that you\nmight otherwise be supressing, because these are the\nareas that need work. For example, what's the first\nthing that pops into your mind when you think of\n\"depression\"? If the answer is \"flying a kite\", then\nfollow the chain... What do you think of when you\nthink of \"kite\" and \"flying\"... You'll be surprised\nhow quickly this takes you right down to an event in\nyour childhood or an unresolved conflict that might\nhave happened a year ago.\n\n2 - Looking for lies. A chair cannot make you\ndepressed. A lampshade cannot make you depressed. Only\nanother person can make you depressed. I believe it is\nbecause a chair and a lampshade cannot lie. Only a\nperson can lie. Depression, it seems to me, comes from\nbelieving a lie. That conflict (between reality and\nthe lie) takes up so much mental energy to maintain,\nit drains you as a whole. You may find, after using\ntechnique #1, that it leads to you to this conclusion\n#2. For example, after free associating your way to an\nevent, you might find that it was when someone told\nyou that you weren't worth a hill of beans. The\nproblem is not that they insulted you, the problem is\nthat you believed the lie. Beware, giving up on a lie\nthat we've believed in for a long time is tougher than\nit sounds.\n\n3 - This one is going to sound goofy, especially after\nwading in deeply with the other two techniques. Get\nsome light to shine on the cells in the back of your\neyes. Go outside for an extended period of time\nwithout sunglasses (no need to stare at the sun or a\nlight-bulb, indirect light will do). Use one of those\ngentle light therapy products like www.everlyte.com .\nTake a trip on a sailboat. Spend a few hours in open\nfields on sunny days. It's those cells in the eyes\nthat produce much of the chemical that pills and\nherbal remedies seek to replace, but the cells in the\neyes put the chemicals where they are needed, in your\nbrain, and not in your stomach and everywhere else.\nThis third technique will help you with the other two,\nallowing you to think clearly, and get out from being\nstuck in a loop.\n\nI hope this \"whole-istic\" answer is as helpful to you\nas it has been to me over the years.

Over 90 percent of water systems meet EPA's standards for tap water quality. The best source of specific information about your drinking water is your water supplier. Water suppliers that serve the same people year-round are required to send their customers an annual water quality report (sometimes called a consumer confidence report). Contact your water supplier to get a copy or see if your report is posted on-line.

How will I know if my water isn't safe to drink?\nA: Your water supplier must notify you by newspaper, mail, radio, TV, or hand-delivery if your water doesn't meet EPA or state standards or if there is a waterborne disease emergency. The notice will describe any precautions you need to take, such as boiling your water. Follow the advice of your water supplier if you ever receive such a notice. The most common drinking water emergency is contamination by disease-causing germs. Boiling your water for one minute will kill these germs.

What should I do?", "patient_answer": "Persistent fatigue which is not alleviated by sleep is a characteristic of many chronic conditions. Debilitating fatigue can also occur without an obvious illness and, after six months, is classified as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Milder forms have been dubbed ‘TATT’ (tired all the time).\n\nFatigue can often be traced back to a viral infection, but this may not be the only culprit. It usually results from a combination of several factors, such as poor diet, overwork, a viral or bacterial infection, bereavement, stress, physical exhaustion, exposure to toxins etc. Its does not respond readily to modern drugs, so many sufferers turn towards alternative and complementary medicine in their quest for a solution.\n\nThe treatment strategy which has worked with my patients is to close all possible avenues where diet or lifestyle may be inadequate by using a multi-dimensional approach. This means making an effort to ensure an above-average nutrient-intake by eating a healthy diet coupled with taking a range of good-quality supplements. In addition, I prescribe herbal medicine with immune-stimulating properties. \n\nNutrition\n\nIt is especially important for people with fatigue to choose a healthy diet. However, even when eating in this way, a person with fatigue may not reach daily nutrient-intake targets because of poor absorption and poor appetite due to lack of exercise. Hence, nutrient supplementation is an important, essential strategy to augment a healthy diet. A supplement programme for fatigue should start with a basic ‘multi’. This will provide most of the vitamins and minerals needed by the body at essential requirement levels. However, it will not contain enough calcium and magnesium, because these are required in much higher quantities than will fit into a single ‘multi’. Extra calcium will be required if fewer than three portions of dairy products are eaten per day. More magnesium is required if the intake of wholegrains, nuts, beans and seeds is low. (In fact, magnesium deficiency is very common in fatigue.) It is best to take these two minerals together in a good bone formula in the ratio of 2:1 calcium to magnesium\n\nA group of symptoms often accompanying fatigue is related to inflammation. This shows up as catarrh, skin rash, dry skin or eadaches. There are two approaches to reduce inflammation: increasing intake of (a) antioxidants and (b) omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. Therefore, extra vitamin C is likely to be useful. For optimal nutrition, take at least 500mg daily as a supplement which, again, is much higher than will go into a single ‘multi’ tablet. \n\nI have written about the importance of getting the right balance of essential fatty acids in a previous Healthspan magazine.5 For fatigue sufferers, as well as having anti-inflammatory properties, it is the direct benefit that omega-3 fatty acids have on boosting normal immune function that is particularly important.\n\nHerbs\n\nFor those with CFS, herbal medicine seems to have a very special role in normalising the immune system, which cannot be effected by essential nutrients alone. In fact, the more severe and persistent the fatigue, the more important it seems to be to augment the nutritional approach above with immune-supportive herbs. Since herbal treatments for CFS have to be individually prescribed, a visit to a professional is necessary. Contact the College of Practitioners (01424 776780) or the National Institute of Medical Herbalists (01392 426022) to find a registered herbal practitioner in your area. Herbal prescriptions normally include those with outspoken traditional use for supporting the immune and nervous systems. St John’s Wort is particularly useful, since it appears to act in both domains. Echinacea, which can be used to help overcome exposure to viruses and to reduce the number of relapses, does not raise vitality in the same way.

They occur in unusual circumstances and/or in patients who develop a water/salt disturbance or have underlying metabolic problems. Sometimes we see it in patients with psychiatric problems. Drinking 9 glasses/day is quite healthy and will not harm you.", "doctor_answer": "As we learned from the University of Florida's College of Health and Human Performance, there's a condition known as \"water intoxication,\" or hyponatremia, which isn't uncommon among marathoners and triathletes. \n\nAs these athletes consume large amounts of water over the course of a race, blood plasma increases and dilutes the salt content of the blood. While this is happening, the athlete is also losing salt by sweating. Consequently, the amount of salt available to the body tissues decreases, and, over time, the loss interferes with brain, heart, and muscle function. \n\nAccording to the experts at iVillage, consumption of large amounts of water is often associated with obsessive-compulsive behaviors. When a person consumes too much of this good thing, essential electrolytes in the blood stream become diluted and affect the control of the heart beat. \n\nHealthy adults require approximately three quarts of fluid each day, half of which comes from food and half from beverages.

Polluting your body in such a manner, though it may be a personal choice, should be done in your own home, in your own room, where you can not possibly interact with anyone else.\n\nThe reason for this in my opinion, is that 2nd hand smoke from smoking kills just as much as regular smoking.  And drinking puts others in danger from your wild attitude swings, to temper inflarments.\n\nDrinking and smoking both cause harm to the general public, so, i'm sorry, but to me both of them are wrong.\n\nIf I were to choose which would be worse, i would say alchol.  The main reason for this is that people who are 'knackered up' are very dangerous for a short period of time (untill they sober up) and are just fine untill they drink again.  So, the problem is transitory.  But due to that exact nature, it can become increasingly difficult to control a person who drinks quite a bit of booze.  So this makes for an unpredictable person.\n\nSmoking, on the other hand, is a long term effect, and thus isn't considered a direct threat to most people.  To me, however it is considered disrespectful, and a statment that you want me to die.  But, to others as the effects happen over a long period of time, and chances of it actually affecting your mental state to make you hurt someone is rare, then it isn't considered as big a threat as drinking.\n\nI just dont condone either.

Lifetime risk of bipolar I disorder is often quoted as around 1%, but when bipolar II is included the true rate may be around 4%.[13]\n\nMore than two-thirds of people with bipolar disorder have at least one close relative with the disorder or with unipolar major depression, indicating that the disease has a heritable component. Studies seeking to identify the genetic basis of bipolar disorder indicate that susceptibility stems from multiple genes. Scientists are continuing their search for these genes using advanced genetic analytic methods and large samples of families affected by the illness. The researchers are hopeful that identification of susceptibility genes for bipolar disorder, and the brain proteins they code for, will make it possible to develop better treatments and preventive interventions targeted at the underlying illness process.", "doctor_answer": "I wouldn't bank on it although it is a possibility.

I'm an Audiologist and work in an Ear, Nose and Throat Doctors' office.  There are different kinds of ear infections. Swimmers ear is in the external ear canal and is typically treated with ear drops and keeping the ear dry.  \n\n     A middle ear infection is a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum and often accompanies a head cold, or in young children can occur during teething, or in infancy can even happen if the baby is bottle fed while laying flat.  To relieve the discomfort, OTC pain relievers are usually recommended, and it often helps to apply heat, such as a hot water bottle, against the ear.  If accompanied by fever, antibiotics are often prescribed and it is VERY important to administer them properly for the full dosage to ensure that ALL the bacteria have been killed.  Otherwise, the bacteria can regrow and may become resistant to the milder antibiotics.  \n\n     If the infections keep coming back, or if the fluid doesn't drain even after the antibiotics have killed the bacteria, surgical options may be considered.  This is especially true in the case of young children, if the decrease in hearing is not resolving because it can effect the child's speech development.  The surgeon makes an incision in the eardrum, draws out the fluid, cleans the middle ear space, and usually places a tube through the incision.  The tube simply maintains an opening through the ear drum to maintain equal air pressure in the middle ear.  Most tubes are designed to fall out of the eardrum as the healing process occurs -- usually about six months after surgery.   The surgery is very common and is done as a same-day procedure in most cases, only because the space is so small that the patient must be very still.  With adults, many specialists will perform the surgery in their office using only a local anestetic.

His father had ear infections his whole life, so I guess he just inherited the tendancy for ear infections from his dad.  His first set of tubes was around his first birthday.  The hardest part was not feeding him before and after -- he was so mad and he didn't understand.  Another set of tubes and an adenoisectomy were done when he was five.  Then he started getting frequent throat ifections so we had to remove the tonsils a couple years later.  He's now 14 and only gets earaches occasionally.\n\n     An inner ear infection often causes dizziness and sometimes ringing in the ear and/or sudden hearing loss.

As in all athletes, needs for energy and protein are higher than the non-athlete. A high carbohydrate diet is essential to optimize muscle glycogen stores, which are the preferred source of energy during prolonged activity.\n\nUsually protein intake in the vegetarian athlete is lower than the meat-eating athlete and carbohydrate will then need to be 60-65 percent of total calories so protein is not used for energy. Depending on the activity and duration 6-10 grams (gm) of carbohydrate per kilogram (1 kg) (1 kg = 2.2 pounds) of body weight is practiced.

Here is the situation.  Chemo can take care of the problem right away, but the doctor always says that, some can live an extended 2 years, or 3 years.  And some die right away from the chemicals.  This is with late stages of cancer.  Now, for early stages, it helps the problem but your health is deteriorated. They say that chemo affects the cancer and your normal body cells.  How many people you know, who have had late stages of cancer, and lived through it pass 5 yours with chemo therapy?  I bet you that you have never even heard of it.  Even if someone has, how many people is that compared to that masses?  The problem with other medicines is that the pharmaceautical companies cannot control that product.  What if it was tree bark say for instance.  How many people do you know will buy the pills if they can just walk up to any tree and bite a piece off to save themselves?  See?  So, USA doctors are familiar with these remedies, but they do not talk about it.  Try asking your doctor about green algae, or cesium chloride, or paw paw, etc etc.  Then they start to talk.  Otherwise, they wont say a word.  And if you dont know, how can you ask?  So, the doctors lips are sealed tight.  The individual doctors on the other hand are sometimes scared to talk about it.  It is because, if they open their mouths, they would be facing the whole medical community.  Alot of them go into the medical field to help people, and some go in it for money.  But, the top ranking ones in control are all in it for money.  If not, they would have never gotten their position.  I do not suggest you go with chemo therapy.  You can look up some alternative medicine to cancer and they are all over the place on the net.  The best ranked one is cesium chloride, paw paw, and along with others.  Some health websites even have a place where you can go and tell them your stage of cancer and which type of cancer, and they will sell you a package based on your individual problem.  There are also some doctors scattered all over the USA who specialize in cancer.  You never hear about them right?  Well, they wont be bothered by the medical community if they do a small operation without much advertising.  But, they all report about 90% survival rates on cancers that regular cancer doctors give up on.  And if that doctor didnt give up, do you expect to live anyways?  No.  I speak out to you because I dont want you to die like the two of my friends who have already died.  Certain doctors even said that they could cure it with 80% survival rate.  But, I didnt have the money to help them.  So, I am speaking out in hopes that nothing happens to you and you survive.  Regardless of your stage of cancer.  Cesium chloride is what works best.  Look it up, its everywhere.  Even oxygen drops help.  You can use them both at the same time.  The thing is with these alternatives is that, some of them make you feel extremely bad at the beginning, but after a while you get used to it, and then you are gone with the cancer before you know it.  So dont feel discouraged.  Oxygen drops keep cancer from growing because your body can live with more oxygen.  As a matter of fact, it helps circulate your blood.  Cancer cannot live at the sight of oxygen.  It has been said that not enough oxygen is what causes cancer. I dont know what the cause is, because there are many causes.  But, cesium chloride and oxygen drops will take care of it.  And one more thing, some of these remedies cannot be sold as a cancer treatment.  So, they are sold as vitamins.  But, in their website, they are allowed to say what it cures.  But, their labels cannot say a word about cancer.  So, you should start in the vitamin section of the internet.

Oxycontin is long-term, extended release, whereas Percocet 10/325 mg is a short-term four hour treatment.  Oxycodone and Percocet are fundamentally the same.  Vicodin is Hydrocodone, and Oxycontin is the long-term version of Oxycodone.

Snoring may be more frequent when you have not had enough sleep. \nSleeping on your side. Sleeping on your side may eliminate snoring. Try sewing a pocket in the middle of the back of your pajama top, putting a tennis ball into the pocket, and stitching it closed.

Breathing problems caused by colds or allergies can disturb airflow, leading to snoring. \nUsing nasal strips. Nasal strips, such as Breathe Right, widen the nostrils and improve airflow.", "doctor_answer": "There is also a less known, but very effective way to stop snoring.

This is only one possible reason, however."}, {"question": "Do cockroaches transmit diseases?", "patient_answer": "Cockroaches are the most repulsive of all household pests. Not only do they look disgusting, but they act disgusting. According to the National Pest Control Association cockroaches can contaminate food and transmit disease\n\ncarrying organisms, including staphylococci, strep, colform molds, salmonella, yeast’s and clostridia. They also spread parasites that cause toxoplasmosis, an illness that can causes birth defects if the pregnant women gets infected.\n\nCockroaches spread disease by carrying contaminated organisms onto your countertop or onto your leftout food. Roaches will eat animal and human feces, rotten and contaminated food, book bindings, leather, and even the\n\nglue on canned food labels. They like the glue in paper bags and can be transported from grocery store to homes via the bags.\n\nThere are 4 types of cockroaches. The German Cockroach; the most common and the smallest of the species. American Cockroach; light brown with yellowish wings, can’t really fly, but glides. Oriental Cockroach; dark reddish brown. Brown Banded Cockroach; yellowish or brown with brown bands on wings. Cockroaches can grow to be 2 inches long.\n\nAs for reproduction, all cockroaches produce offspring the same way. The females produce 20 to 30 egg capsules per cycle, each containing between 15 and 40 eggs. Females can have up to 30,000 offspring in their lifetime.\n\nCockroaches like dark, moist, warm places to live in. The kitchen and bathroom fit this description but so do other places like laundry baskets. They will also live in boxes, paperbags and books. It is easy to transport them from house to house and even across oceans.\n\nPrevention and control are important in the fight to eliminate cockroaches. Killing only the ones you see is not effective, because if you see one there is 300 in hiding. To eliminate them in your house you have to get rid of their food and water, eliminate the present population with a poison and prevent future cockroaches from invading your house.\n\nAlways plug drains on sinks when not in use. Cockroaches can’t swim but they can come in through sewer pipes if the water has subsided. Keep counters, floors and cupboard free from food and crumbs.\n\nInsecticide sprays can be used to control cockroaches. You can call out a professional and pay for the service to your home. You can also spray yourself with an insecticide you buy at a home center. You have to make sure you get all the hiding places, cracks, crevices, baseboards and under\n\nsinks. you can also place boric acid powder along the same places and then when a cockroach walks through it, it clings to their feet and antennae. When they ingest the powder it kills them. Boric acid is fairly safe to use and\n\nhandle. Ingested in large quantities can make a human sick too. Cockroach bait houses are also effective as a supplement to spraying.\n\nYou must prevent cockroaches from entering your house by sealing up any holes and cracks along baseboards, door frames and windows. Seal up the space around water and sewer pipes, and electrical and telephone lines where they come inside. Keep all piles of debris and mulches and compost piles away from your house. Spray the perimeter of your house frequently. Cockroaches are stow aways and will come into your house in boxes, bags, pet food cartons (cockroaches love dog food), appliances and laundry, so inspect them carefully.", "doctor_answer": "It is believed that the cockroach may be a reservoir for a range of bacteria including salmonella, staphylococcus and streptococcus.

Need big time reliable answers for bacterial infection that doesn't go away! Definately a system wide", "patient_answer": "Sounds like you are motivated to find out what is wrong that is causing this problem. A doctor is always the best source of information for health issues.\n\nPerhaps you should do some research, then go see a doctor.  If you are going in circles with the one you are going to, then maybe you should speak to a different one. You can still keep going to the same doctor you are now. You do not have to switch doctors; you are just getting an additional opinion.\n\nHopefully you are in a country where you can see a gynocologist. If you are, and they are not helping, maybe you should see a general practitioner, mention all the symptoms you are having and any other things you might have going on now.  Maybe they can point you to a different type of specialist.\n\nIf you have a bacterial infection, and they are certain it is one, it seems odd they have not identified which one it is. I am certainly no doctor but it seems like they could do a bacteria culture of it in less than 7 months.  Once it is identified, doctors frequently follow up by prescribing a course of antibiotics.\n\nViruses generally do not respond to antibiotics but lots of types of bacteria do. The antibiotic must be matched to the particular bacteria though.\n\nAlso, in addition to different species of bacteria, there are different strains of each species.  They can reproduce quickly, have very short lifespans, and  then die. This produces many generations in a much shorter time than humans - a lot faster that 20 years or so.\n\nWhat this means is they can evolve quickly.  They can actually therefore adapt to certain medicines and develop resistence.  This is a very simplified form of evolution, which is a very real phenomenon. I am not saying that you have a strain that is resistant to a particular medicine.  I am just pointing out it happens that some strains have evolved a little immunity to some medicines that normally work on other members of their species.\n\nWith antibiotics, it is important to stick to the particular medicine your doctor has prescribed for you.  You want to take it at the prescribed times/frequencies. Do not forget to take it or just stop taking it because you do not think it is working.  If for some reason you cannot take it because for example, it is making you incredibly ill - let your doctor know right away, so they can figure out what to do right then.  They might want to switch you to a different drug right then, or need you to stay on it. If an antibiotic has made you really sick, remember its name (write it down) so you can tell a doctor the next time you see one and he asks if you are allergic or have had any problems from any particular medication.\n\nI am including some links to common conditions that occur in that area.\n\nThe first few links are for yeast infections.  They are pretty common.  Not in the sense that you will get them all the time but in the sense that most women have it at least once in their lifetime. That kind of common.

Normally, it is not something people get because they caught it from someone else. In other words, they are not an STD.  Yeast is all around us in the environment.  It cannot infect someone unless conditions are just the right conditions for it to grow.  Otherwise, well it would be like a pumpkin growing in the Saharah desert.  Probably not going to happen, right?\n\nThere are STDs around that people can catch from other people.  Some are pretty common. You said you do not have one, which is good.  A lot of people do have them.  A lot of people are spreading them. \n\nInfection rates vary per country and go up and down.

To produce the sounds, many people will bend their fingers into unusual positions, or manipulate them in ways which are not commonly experienced in everyday use. For example, bending the fingers right back towards the back of the hand, or pulling them away from the hand.\n\nIn many early motion pictures and subsequently parodied in animated cartoons, the gesture of cracking knuckles was associated with a \"tough guy\" image, especially when accompanied by the implicit or explicit threat of violence.\n\nThe physical mechanism is unknown, but possibilities that have been suggested include:\n\n   1. cavitation within the joint - small cavities of partial vacuum form in the fluid then rapidly collapse, producing a sharp sound (hypothesis in a medical journal)\n   2. the sudden stretching of ligaments (hypothesis by one reader of that journal)\n   3. release of gas from the joints being adjusted (this applies to the popping that can occur in any joint such as during chiropractic manipulation)\n\nA single event is not enough to cause damage to the joint, although it is possible that prolonged joint stress due to cracking knuckles may eventually lead to a higher risk of joint damage. The long-term consequences of this practice have not been studied thoroughly, and the scientific evidence is inconclusive. However, the common parental advice \"Cracking your knuckles gives you arthritis\" may be simply a device to deter children from this practice, which many people find annoying because of the sound it makes. In actual fact, study by Castellanos and Axelrod showed that arthritis was not a product of knuckle cracking. They evaluated 300 consecutive outpatients at Mount Carmel Mercy Hospital to determine whether habitual knuckle cracking is a risk factor for hand dysfunction. They found no relation with osteoarthritis, but noted that 'knuckle crackers were more likely to have hand swelling and lower grip strength'\n\nA chiropractic perspective:\n\n    \"As a joint is being distracted, the capsule invaginates inward and as the stress on the capsule reaches a certain threshold, it suddenly snaps back from the synovial fluid, increasing the volume of the capsule (and decreasing pressure) and causing the audible sound. The sudden increase in the volume causes the tension to drop, allowing the joint to increase in movement. Eventually, the elastic limit of the capsule is reached and the process stops. The time elapsed during all this is shorter than that required for completion of the stretch reflex, so it can occur without muscular resistance. The sudden jerk on the capsule and the other periarticular tissues is theorized to cause firing of the high-threshold mechanoreceptors.\"", "doctor_answer": "What's really happening when you \"crack\" your knuckles is that you are either pushing the joint back into or out of its normal position. Joints are the meeting points of two separate bones which are held together by connecting tissues and ligaments. A thick, clear lubricant (made mostly of carbon dioxide and some nitrogen) called synovial fluid is found between the bones. When you stretch or pull your finger to get that desired popping noise, you are causing the bones to pull apart. Pressure is reduced on the synovial fluid and bubbles form that quickly expand and then burst - which is why you get that noise\nSo no harm in cracking"}, {"question": "how is aids spread?", "patient_answer": "aids commenly know as HIV is spread by sharing infected needles,by sexual intercourse ,and if a pregnant woman is already infected her new born will be too.", "doctor_answer": "New evidence has come to light that AIDS is being spread by a secret government agency.

There are a number of questions that you should ask your doctor to help you better understand your disease.  First, HCV viral loads are reported in different units - IU/mL or copies/mL.  You likely have a \"high\" HCV viral load (usually anything greater than 600,000 IU/mL is considered \"high\").  The viral load has NO correlation with the severity of disease.  You can have a high viral load and no liver damage or a low viral load and extensive liver damamage - it depends.  However, it may make the infection more difficult to treat.\n\nYou should ask your doctor about your HCV genotype (usually 1, 2, 3, or 4) and discuss a liver biopsy.  The liver biopsy (thin needle inserted into liver to collect small sample of liver tissue) is the only difinitive way to determine the extent of damage in the liver.  It will tell your doctor how much inflammation the virus is causing.  With long term inflammation (over years - usually 10-20 years) inflammation can cause fibrosis.

Try taking short walks and doing light activities that do not cause pain. Then gradually start your regular activities. Even if you have severe pain, bed rest of more than a few days can cause the muscles in your back—as well as the rest of your body—to become weaker. \nUse ice or heat to relieve pain. Apply ice 3 times a day. Do not use ice for longer than 15 to 20 minutes at a time. Heat relieves pain for some people, but it should not be used too soon after an injury. Ask your health professional about using ice and heat to reduce your pain. \nTake nonprescription pain relievers to help reduce pain. Examples include aspirin (such as Bayer), acetaminophen (such as Tylenol), ibuprofen (such as Motrin), and naproxen sodium (such as Aleve).  Exercising may help speed your recovery, prevent reinjury to your back, and reduce the risk of disability from back pain.

To avoid false negative results, the first endoscopy must be done while the patient is on a normal, gluten-containing diet or very shortly after going on a gluten-free diet. Sometimes the endoscopy is repeated after the patient has been on a gluten-free diet, in order to ensure that the bowel has healed. However, upper endoscopy always carries a risk of false negative results. This is because coeliac disease may or may not damage villi throughout the entire small intestine, and upper endoscopy only examines the upper part of the intestine. In a patient whose intestinal damage is located further down, the biopsy may come back negative. If the endoscopy is positive the diagnosis is confirmed, but if it is negative, the diagnosis is not necessarily excluded.\n\nSerology has been proposed as a screening measure, because the presence in the blood of IgA antibodies reactive against gluten and tissue transglutaminase is indicative of coeliac disease. Like the endoscopy, these tests are not accurate in patients who have been on a gluten-free diet for some time; they must be performed while the person is on a normal diet or within a relatively short time after eliminating gluten. A thorough workup includes four tests:\n\nAnti-tissue Transglutaminase Antibody (tTG), IgA. This test is sometimes used alone. If this test is positive it is highly likely that the patient has celiac disease. tTG test is not reliable in children before the age of 2. \nAnti-Gliadin Antibodies (AGA), IgG and IgA. These tests are often useful when testing young symptomatic children, but they are found in fewer coeliacs than Anti-tTG, and their presence does not automatically indicate coeliac disease because they are found in some other disorders. Some people have an IgA deficiency that causes a false negative test; due to this and other factors, the IgA test has a relatively high rate of false negatives. \nAnti-Endomysial Antibodies (EMA), IgA. This test is being replaced by the Anti-tTG test because both tests measure the autoantibodies that cause the tissue damage associated with coeliac disease. Many physicians still order this test. This test as tTG test is also not reliable in children before the age of 2. \nAnti-Reticulin Antibodies (ARA), IgA. Anti-ARA is not ordered as frequently as it once was, because it is less sensitive and less specific than the other tests. It is found in about 60% of people with coeliac disease and 25% of those with dermatitis herpetiformis. \nMany doctors will not consider positive blood tests as definitive proof of coeliac disease, but will still require biopsy confirmation. A growing minority consider coeliac disease to be diagnosed where the patient has positive blood tests and shows improved symptoms after the adoption of a gluten-free diet. Because upper endoscopies are uncomfortable, expensive, and may produce false negative results, this group of doctors considers serology tests and a positive response to eliminating gluten from the diet to be sufficient for diagnosis. A small minority of doctors advocate gluten-free diets even for symptom-free patients who have not had an endoscopy but have had a positive blood test, because some confirmed coeliacs are completely symptom-free throughout their lives; in symptom-free patients, the purpose of the diet is to avoid nutritional deficiencies, osteoporosis, and intestinal lymphoma.\n\nOther tests that may assist in the diagnosis are a full blood count, electrolytes, renal function and liver enzymes. Coagulation testing may be useful to identify deficiency of vitamin K, which predisposes patients to hemorrhage.", "doctor_answer": "the only cure is to go on a gluten-free diet.  then the health risks all return to normal, your body will heal and your symptoms will go away.  it may sound hard at first, but for me, going gluten-free was like having my life handed back to me.  go to celiac.com and find out what foods/ingredients are forbidden and get started!  it is SO worth it to not feel sick, to have energy, and to be able to eat w/o pain and misery!! best of luck to you."}, {"question": "Why do my eyes get dry every night at 10 pm?", "patient_answer": "Well, if you use your vision for precision necessary excercises like reading or looking carefully at computer screens, pictures, etc etc, they will get dry.

Consult a physician for diagnosis.\n\nHow is psoriasis diagnosed?\nWhen the condition progresses to the development of silvery scales, the physician can usually diagnose psoriasis with a medical examination of the nails and skin. Confirmation of diagnosis may be done with a skin biopsy -- taking a small skin specimen to examine under a microscope.\n\nTreatment for psoriasis:\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation and slow down the rapid growth and shedding of skin cells. At the present time, there is no cure for psoriasis. Specific treatment for psoriasis will be determined by your physician based on: \n\nyour overall health, age, and medical history \nseverity of the condition \nyour tolerance of specific medications, procedures, or therapies \nyour opinion or preference \nTreatment may include one, or a combination, of the following: \n\nointments and creams to moisturize the skin \nsunlight or ultraviolet light exposure (under a physician's supervision) \nsteroids such as cortisone creams \nvitamin D cream \ncreams containing salicylic acid or coal tar \nAnthralin (a drug that treats the thicker, hard-to-treat patches of psoriasis) \nmethotrexate (an anti-cancer drug that interrupts the growth of skin cells)"}, {"question": "What can I take  to fall asleep faster without taking any drugs?", "patient_answer": "Warm milk and turkey", "doctor_answer": "i listen 2 music b4 i sleep it usually relaxes me"}, {"question": "Working out on Gazelle.?", "patient_answer": "Gazelle???\nThats cruelty to animals!!lol", "doctor_answer": "I personally did mine every day for a year 30 minutes at a time it helped so much i went from 171pds to 117 with out counting calories, however i had a baby recently and am just now getting back on it it seem to be helping."}, {"question": "do most girls masterbate?", "patient_answer": "It is estimated that 80% of women and 96% of men masturbate.", "doctor_answer": "Yes...

How to do it safely?", "patient_answer": "Douching is rinsing or cleaning out the vagina (also called the birth canal) by squirting water or other solutions (such as vinegar, baking soda, or douching solutions you can buy at drug and grocery stores) into the vagina. The water or solutions are held in a bottle and squirted into the vagina through tubing and a nozzle.\n\nIs douching safe?\n\nHealth care providers do not recommend douching to clean the vagina. Douching changes the delicate chemical balance in the vagina (and the vaginal flora), which can make a woman more prone to bacterial infections. It also can spread existing vaginal or cervical infections up into the pelvic organs (uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries).\n\nResearch shows that women who douche on a routine basis tend to have more problems than women who do not douche or who rarely douche. These problems include vaginal irritation, infections (called bacterial vaginosis or BV), and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Women who douche often are also more at risk for getting pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of a woman's pelvic organs. It is caused by bacteria, which can travel from a woman's vagina and cervix up into her pelvic organs. If left untreated, PID can lead to infertility (not being able to get pregnant) and ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus). Both BV and PID can lead to serious problems during pregnancy, such as infection in the baby, problems with labor, and early delivery.", "doctor_answer": "I LOVE  MRS.

Psychological treatment can improve symptoms, and this improvement is often maintained in the long term. \n\nCognitive behaviour therapy \nCognitive behaviour therapy aims to change patterns of thinking, beliefs and behaviours that may trigger anxiety and obsessive compulsive symptoms. This therapy uses education to promote control over symptoms. The education includes information that helps to expose myths about the causes of OCD. \n\nPart of the therapy involves gradually exposing the person to situations that trigger their obsessions and, at the same time, helping them to reduce their compulsions and avoidance behaviours. This process is gradual and usually begins with the less feared situations. The exposure tasks and prevention of compulsions are repeated daily and consistently until anxiety decreases. Over time, this allows the person to rebuild trust in their capacity to manage and function, even with anxiety.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy should be undertaken with a skilled, specialist mental health professional. Over-use of alcohol, drugs and some medications may interfere with the success of this type of treatment. \n\nAnxiety management techniques\nAnxiety management techniques can help a person to manage their own symptoms. Such techniques can include relaxation training, slow breathing techniques, meditation and hyperventilation control. These techniques require regular practice and are most effective if used together with a cognitive behavioural treatment program. \n\nPsychotherapy \nPsychotherapy with a psychologist may assist the person with OCD to deal with issues and problems that have been caused or exacerbated by the disorder. \n\nMedication\nSome medications, especially antidepressants that affect the serotonin system, have been found to reduce symptoms of OCD. This medication can only be prescribed by a medical practitioner. \n\nSide effects of antidepressants may include nausea, headaches, dry mouth, blurred vision, dizziness and feeling sleepy. These effects often decline after the first few weeks of treatment. If your side effects are severe or last for a long time, you should discuss this with your doctor. \n\nIt usually takes several weeks for medication to deliver any effects. When reducing or stopping medication, the dose should be reduced slowly under medical supervision.\n\nHospitalisation\nAssessment and treatment in hospital can be helpful for some people, particularly when they first begin treatment for OCD or when symptoms are severe. A stay in hospital may last from several days to a few weeks. \n\nSupport groups and education\nSupport groups allow people with OCD and their families to meet in comfort and safety, and give and receive support. The groups also provide the opportunity to learn more about the disorder and to develop social networks.", "doctor_answer": "Treating OCD is not an easy task. One of the most successful therapies involves placing a person in a situation that usually triggers his anxiety, but the patient is not allowed to engage in the compulsive behavior that is the typical response. The idea is that eventually the stress from not performing the compulsive behavior will lessen over time to the point where the person no longer feels compelled to do it.\n\nPrescription drugs have also proven successful in reducing a person's obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors; this approach will not necessarily resolve the problem entirely but will free a person to live a normal life while confronting the issues appropriately through therapy."}, {"question": "I am at the age of 40, why my teeth are becoming loose?", "patient_answer": "The is a condition called gingivitis, it is a gum disease which can cause your teeth to become loose.

Strabismus is when the eye muscles do not work together perfectly, so one eye points in a different direction than the other, either part-time or full-time.  Our brain does NOT like to see two images at once - too confusing to process, so the brain often picks the eye with the better image and \"turns off\" the eye with the poorer image, thereby ignoring the nerve signals from the poorer eye.\n\nWhen the brain learns to ignore the image from one eye, the nerves do not develop properlay and the vision often gets worse in the poorer eye.  This is called amblyopia.  Amblyopia is a long lasting loss of the quality of vision in one eye, usually resulting from strabismus (above) or anisometropia.  Anisometropia is when one eye has a very different prescription than the other, so the brain never gets proper visual signal from the poorer eye.\n\nThe result of all of these conditions is a \"lazy\" eye, an eye that does not work as well as the other eye.  \n\nSadly, the later that the diagnosis of \"lazy\" eye occurs, the harder and less complete is the recovery.  If a lazy eye is detected and treated by age 4, most of the visual develop can be rehabilitated, and both eyes will probably see well.  If the lazy eye is detected around age 6-7, the worse eye can become better, but will probably never be as good as the better eye.  Some doctors think that after age 13-14, almost no improvement will ever come from any treatments, the nerve damage is probably permanant, and little improvement is ever expected.\n\nSo, it depends on the age of the patient.

In addition you may be infected with a large number of other Sexually Transmitted Diseases.\n\nI have included information from a web page of the Center for Disease Control.\n\n\"Can I get HIV from anal sex?\n\nYes. In fact, unprotected (without a condom) anal sex (intercourse) is considered to be very risky behavior. It is possible for either sex partner to become infected with HIV during anal sex. HIV can be found in the blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, or vaginal fluid of a person infected with the virus. In general, the person receiving the semen is at greater risk of getting HIV because the lining of the rectum is thin and may allow the virus to enter the body during anal sex. However, a person who inserts his penis into an infected partner also is at risk because HIV can enter through the urethra (the opening at the tip of the penis) or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis.\n\nNot having (abstaining from) sex is the most effective way to avoid HIV. If people choose to have anal sex, they should use a latex condom. Most of the time, condoms work well. However, condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex. Thus, even with a condom, anal sex can be risky. A person should use generous amounts of water-based lubricant in addition to the condom to reduce the chances of the condom breaking.\""}, {"question": "Is a chiropractor a real doctor?", "patient_answer": "In order to be accepted into any chiropractic college, students must take the same pre-requisites as any future medical student.  This includes 1 year of math, english, physics, and 2 years of chemistry (all with accompanying lab classes).  Chiropractic students receive a very similar education as medical students, with emphasis on diagnosis of many different medical conditions, lab work (blood or urine analysis), and basic sciences (physiology, pathology, basic anatomy, and neuroanatomy).  In addition, chiropractic students receive over 100 hours in palpation and technique courses, much more thoroughly than any Physical therapist or even MD attempting to 'manipulate' the spine.  Over 100 hours are also dedicated to learning radiology - how to take x-ray and interpret them - again, much more thoroughly than any medical student (those that are not specializing in radiology, of course).  So, yes, chiropractors are real doctors, and can recognize many different medical conditions and refer out appropriately.  Several studies have also shown that chiropractors are superior in dealing with musculoskeletal conditions (ie - neck pain and back pain), as well as other complaints than many MDs may ignore or cannot do anything about.", "doctor_answer": "I believe you are correct.

If your family has good insurance (or Medicaid -- most states covers kids above the poverty level), I would start with an allergist or a pulmonologist.  If you lack insurance, there are often community clinics where you can go for treatment.\n\nAsthma is a chronic disease that isn't really cured but can often be very effectively controlled.  Poor control causes many issues (and you know that!) and can even be life threatening.\n\nHow is it managed?  The first step is to try and figure out what causes your asthma.  This can often be an allergy (although asthma can also be triggered by other things such as cold air and exercise).  Regardless of the trigger, a doctor will work with you to reduce that trigger.  (In the case of allergies, this can involve everything from covering the mattress if the allergy is to dust to nasal sprays to allergy shots to limiting your exposure to certain things).\n\nThe doctor may also prescribe a slower acting medicine to help reduce the frequency and severity of attacks.  This most often an inhaler but could also be a pill.  And this is important:  asthma seems to sort of feed on itself and treatment can help reduce the inflamation.  Also important is to understand that this will not stop an astma attack that you justt started having -- it takes days to have an impact.\n\nIn addition, a doctor may presecribe a fast acting inhaler (often called a rescue inhaler).  This is designed to be used to treat a current astma attack.\n\nSo the plan:  a) reduce the triggers that cause the asthma; b) longer term medication to help soothe the inflamation and reduce the severity/frequemcy; and c) a rescue inhaler when a and b fail.  If you find yourself using the rescue inhaler often, contact your doctor as the first two steps probably need refined.\n\nMake sense?

It's a natural anti-nausea agent, and will help stop a migraine in its tracks.  It wont make one BETTER, but it can stop it from getting worse.\n\nThe fastest way to administer is to buy ginger root powder (available in grocery stores in the spices aisle), and add a half-teaspoonful to your favorite tea.  If it's taste is a little too much for you, you can buy it in pill form at most vitamin/supplement stores.  (Also great for helping prevent motionsickness!)\n\nCaffeine sometimes works.\n\nIf the symptoms are particularly bad, I like a cold compress in a pitch dark room in an attempt to sleep it off.  If you room isn't dark enough, tape tinfoil on the inside of the windows to block light.  If you don't have a cold compress, point a small fan at your face.\n\nThe best thing you can do about migraines is learn what your triggers are.  Sometimes it's food (or food combinations), too much light, too much heat, too much exertion, etc.  But involving a doctor is always a good idea.\n\nIf you get a migraine, try to write down everything you did prior to it, hopefully you will be able to narrow down some of your triggers over time.\n\nBest of luck to ya.", "doctor_answer": "If you get a lot of migraines, I would talk to your doctor if you are getting two or more per week.

The choice of therapy depends upon the location and grade of the tumor and the stage of the disease, as well as the general state of the patient (performance status). A number of experimental cancer treatments are also under development.\n\nComplete removal of the cancer without damage to the rest of the body is the goal of treatment. Sometimes this can be accomplished by surgery, but the propensity of cancers to invade adjacent tissue or to spread to distant sites by microscopic metastasis often limits its effectiveness. The effectiveness of chemotherapy is often limited by toxicity to other tissues in the body. Radiation can also cause damage to normal tissue.\n\nBecause \"cancer\" refers to a class of diseases, it is unlikely that there will ever be a single \"cure for cancer\" any more than there will be a single treatment for all infectious diseases.\n[edit]\n\nSurgery\n\nIf the tumor is localized, surgery is often the preferred treatment. Example procedures include mastectomy for breast cancer and prostatectomy for prostate cancer. The goal of the surgery can be either the removal of only the tumor, or the entire organ. Since a single cancer cell can grow into a sizable tumor, removing only the tumor leads to a greater chance of recurrence. A margin of healthy tissue is often resected to make sure all cancerous tissue is removed.\n\nIn addition to removal of the primary tumor, surgery is often necessary for staging, e.g. determining the extent of the disease and whether there has been metastasis to regional lymph nodes. Staging determines the prognosis and the need for adjuvant therapy.\n\nOccasionally, surgery is necessary to control symptoms, such as spinal cord compression or bowel obstruction. This is referred to as palliative treatment.\n[edit]\n\nChemotherapy\n\nChemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with drugs (\"anticancer drugs\") that can destroy cancer cells. It interferes with cell division in various possible ways, e.g. with the duplication of DNA or the separation of newly formed chromosomes. Most forms of chemotherapy target all rapidly dividing cells and are not specific for cancer cells. Hence, chemotherapy has the potential to harm healthy tissue, especially those tissues that have a high replacement rate (e.g. intestinal lining). These cells usually repair themselves after chemotherapy.\n\nBecause some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are often given at the same time. This is called \"combination chemotherapy\"; most chemotherapy regimens are given in a combination.\n\nA novel technique involves taking samples of the patient's tissue before chemotherapy. These tissues samples are screened to ensure they do not contain cancerous cells. The samples are expanded using tissue engineering techniques, and are then re-implanted following high dose chemotherapy in order to recolonise the damaged and somewhat destroyed tissue. A variation upon this method uses allogenic samples (samples donated by a different donor) instead of the patient's own tissue4.\n[edit]\n\nImmunotherapy\n\nImmunotherapy is the use of immune mechanisms against tumors. These are used in various forms of cancer, such as breast cancer (trastuzumab/Herceptin®) but also in leukemia (gemtuzumab ozogamicin/Mylotarg®). The agents are monoclonal antibodies directed against proteins that are characteristic to the cells of the cancer in question, or cytokines that modulate the immune system's response.\n[edit]\n\nRadiation therapy\n\nRadiation therapy (also called radiotherapy, X-ray therapy, or irradiation) is the use of ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation therapy can be administered externally via external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or internally via brachytherapy. The effects of radiation therapy are localised and confined to", "doctor_answer": "Chemo is no therapy.  It tries to kill the cancer before it kills you.  And if it can do this, then you are considered cured.  But, during the time that you have not been cured yet, the chemo destroys your body and deteriorates your health.  Chemo is just something that doctors do to take all the money you have left before you die.  How many people you know have lived more then 5 years after chemo?  Not too many if any at all.  And compared to the masses, its practically nobody.  The best thing for you to do is go to the websites that sell alternative medicines for cancer.  They have such medicines such as CESIUM CHLORIDE, GREEN ALGAE, OXYGEN DROPS, AND PAW PAW, etc etc.  They can cure like 90% of cancers even at their 2nd or 3rd stage.  Timing is critical in times like these.  You can call up some of the websites that only sell cancer medicines.  The medical community will not allow these people to sell medicine.  If they do then it would have to be sold as a health product or vitamins.  So, their labels cannot say anything about cancer.  But, their websites can tell you what it cures and how to use it.  This is how evil the medical people are.  They want to kill you and keep the rest of your money while doing it.  So, instead of going to their dead end route, just go to these websites and look up these medicines.  There are even places that give complete packages on certain cancers depending on what cancer you have, your age, and your health condition, etc etc.  Try looking up DSMO, or something of that sort.

That’s the worst thing you can do in a diet because it slows down your metabolism and your body starts getting more fat from your food intake since, fat is the bodies fastest and easiest type of nutrition[not the healthiest though]. The reason this happen is because this helped us when we were no doing so good as hunters and gathers to keep us alive a bit longer. \n\nBefore I continue let me explain protein, carbohydrates, and fats.\n\nProtein is easiest described as anything that comes from or was an animal such chicken, fish, sirloin, and milk. \n\nCarbohydrates [carbs] can be found almost in anything else even apples.\nGood carbs:\nApples, wheat bread, sourdough bread, grains, and wheat \nBad carbs:\nWhite bread, hamburger buns, hotdog buns, Doritos, and sodas!\n\nGood fats:\nAvocados, pecans, almonds, and peanut butter \n\nThe ratio in your diet varies but I think a good starting point is something like\n[50%Protien:40%Carbs:10%fat]\n\nThis can sound meaningless. So in plain terms consume only good fats [portioned] and you should be okay.  Something like a handful of almonds, or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [separately. not consecutively]. \n\nThe reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because you are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [Proteins are 4 calories, Carbs are 4 calories, Fats are 9 calories] so theoretically if you eat less fats and more proteins you will have a less appetite because you will eat more. \n\nAnother nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself. That’s how the Adkins basically works. If you consume more proteins and less carbs you will lose weight. I leave to you to decide if this is good you.\n\nI would also advice you to split up your day into 5 meals. [warning: it will feel weird because you are not used to eating this decreased amount. Just keep in mind that you will eat in 3 hour and you will quickly noticed that you will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry] if you do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla.\n\nYou are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [if you have been starving yourself or if you don’t exercise].", "doctor_answer": "veg (yum yum yum yum yum)"}, {"question": "What's the quickest way to get over the flu?", "patient_answer": "The old saying \"Plenty of fluids and rest\" rings true. get Nyquil and keep taking the recommended dose as often as you can tolerate it.

Acquired ichtyosis is associated with other systemic diseases, such as hypothyroidism, hepatitis, HIV infection, and some forms of cancer like Hodgkin's lymphoma or leukemia.

You must be of the mind that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.  You must focus your EMOTIONAL energy; be angry with the addiction.  Be mad that you could be twisted and manipulated into this addiction to nicotine.  Remember the wet ragged cough, the trips to the store to buy cigs at inconvenient times, in bad weather, when you are low on money, etc.  Remember how you stink after smoking; how its smell sticks to your clothes, your car, home, etc.  Think about all those megatives and realize that for every cig that you enjoy, several others are not enjoyed but are consumed to satisfy your body's addiction.  \n\nCigarettes are physically addictive, comparable to cocaine or alcohol.

But as a heavy-heavy smoker of 20 years, I will tell you truthfully that quitting smoking takes, first and foremost, WILLPOWER.  Even though the nicotine in your system makes it a \"physical\" addiction, it is also a \"mental\" addiction as well.  You mentally have to stop associating smoking with things that are pleasurable; for me, it was smoking while doing artwork, smoking while out in clubs and having a drink (but smoking in clubs is getting more and more rare).  You will be cranky for about 2 weeks while on the patch and you should try and stay away from other people that smoke; just the smell of a cigarette being lit or even the SOUND of a Bic lighter being lit, was enough to make me want a cigarette!  Keep your hands busy, don't sit around because you will think about it.  Your teeth will look better and as a BIG incentive, your hair and your clothes will not reek of yesterday's smoke.  You will also not have to clean all that yellow-ish nicotine stain off your walls!

These flu viruses occur naturally among birds. Wild birds worldwide carry the viruses in their intestines, but usually do not get sick from them. However, bird flu is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds, including chickens, ducks, and turkeys, very sick and kill them.\n\nBird flu viruses do not usually infect humans, but several cases of human infection with bird flu viruses have occurred since 1997.\n\nThe current outbreak of avian influenza A (H5N1) among poultry in Asia and Europe (see below) is an example of a bird flu outbreak that has caused human infections and deaths. In such situations, people should avoid contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces, and should be careful when handling and cooking poultry. For more information about avian influenza and food safety issues, visit the the World Health Organization website\n\nSymptoms of bird flu in humans have ranged from typical flu-like symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat and muscle aches) to eye infections, pneumonia, severe respiratory diseases (such as acute respiratory distress), and other severe and life-threatening complications.

The\nlong-term users averaged 23.9 years of use, compared with 10.2 years\nin the shorter-term users.

A\nnegative effect was not observed among subjects who had previously\nbeen heavy users but were no longer using the substance. We conclude\nthat marijuana does not have a long-term negative impact on global\nintelligence.”  This study compared IQ scores of individuals aged 9-12\nyears before they started using cannabis, with their scores at 17-20\nyears.  Light users, former users and non-users showed a gain in IQ\nover the same period.\n\nOne reason for the decreased IQ and memory in consistent heavy users\ncould be the fact that long-term cannabis use has been found to\ndecrease blood flow to the front areas of the brain (Neurotoxicology\nand Teratology 2001 Sep-Oct; vol 23 pp. 437-43  Frontal lobe\ndysfunction in long-term cannabis users by  Lundqvist T, Jonsson S,\nWarkentin S. of the Division of Medical Neurochemistry, Lund\nUniversity Hospital, 221 85, Lund, Sweden  \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11711246&dopt=Abstract\n\nA study published in Public Health and Nutrition, June 2001, vol. 4\npp. 781-786 (Dietary intake and nutritional status of US adult\nmarijuana users: results from the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey.

The authors concluded this was associated with different\ndietary habits: “We found higher cigarette-smoking rates and higher\nconsumption of sodas and alcohol, specifically beer, among marijuana\nusers than among non-current marijuana users. Marijuana users also\nconsumed more sodium, fewer fruits, and more pork, cheese, and salty\nsnacks.”  Carotenoids are important anti-oxidants which help to\nprevent cancer and other diseases.

Just like other organs, the heart needs a constant supply of oxygenated blood to feed itself. Coronary Artery Disease is an occlusion (obstruction) of the coronary (heart) arteries resulting from atherosclerosis (arteriosclerosis). When the body goes into more strenuous activity, the heart has to work harder to supply the body's demands for fresh, oxygen-rich blood. \n\n\nAn ischemic heart reacts by giving off a sensation of pain. We call this pain angina, or, more technically, angina pectoris. When the blockage of an artery is complete, for example, when an occluded artery is blocked by a thrombus (blood clot), the result is a heart attack.

That’s the worst thing you can do in a diet because it slows down your metabolism and your body starts getting more fat from your food intake since, fat is the bodies fastest and easiest type of nutrition[not the healthiest though]. The reason this happen is because this helped us when we were no doing so good as hunters and gathers to keep us alive a bit longer. \n\nBefore I continue let me explain protein, carbohydrates, and fats.\n\nProtein is easiest described as anything that comes from or was an animal such chicken, fish, sirloin, and milk. \n\nCarbohydrates [carbs] can be found almost in anything else even apples.\nGood carbs:\nApples, wheat bread, sourdough bread, grains, and wheat \nBad carbs:\nWhite bread, hamburger buns, hotdog buns, Doritos, and sodas!\n\nGood fats:\nAvocados, pecans, almonds, and peanut butter \n\nThe ratio in your diet varies but I think a good starting point is something like\n[50%Protien:40%Carbs:10%fat]\n\nThis can sound meaningless. So in plain terms consume only good fats [portioned] and you should be okay.  Something like a handful of almonds, or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [separately. not consecutively]. \n\nThe reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because you are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [Proteins are 4 calories, Carbs are 4 calories, Fats are 9 calories] so theoretically if you eat less fats and more proteins you will have a less appetite because you will eat more. \n\nAnother nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself. That’s how the Adkins basically works. If you consume more proteins and less carbs you will lose weight. I leave to you to decide if this is good you.\n\nI would also advice you to split up your day into 5 meals. [warning: it will feel weird because you are not used to eating this decreased amount. Just keep in mind that you will eat in 3 hour and you will quickly noticed that you will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry] if you do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla.\n\nYou are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [if you have been starving yourself or if you don’t exercise].", "doctor_answer": "Try to eat healthy food and exercise.

With pegylated interferon therapy and Ribavirin treatment, many people can ERADICATE the virus, meaning the HCV RNA viral load is not detectable with the most sensitive assay.  Some hepatologists consider this a \"cure\" while others are hesitant to use that word.  Once treatment is completed, you typically have an HCV viral load test 6 months after completing therapy.  If there is no detectable virus, then you have achieved a sustained viral response or SVR.  This is very indicative of long term clearance of the virus.  HCV antibodies can still be detectable, even after the virus has been cleared.  A standard HCV antibody screening test would still be positive and life insurance companies may still consider you infected as a result of positive antibody tests.  However, the long term risk of fibrosis and cirrhosis are dramatically reduced if not eliminated.  \n\nThere are reports of sexual transmission of HCV, but it is a very low liklihood.  In fact, the CDC does not make any specific recommendations regarding safe sex between partners with different HCV status.\n\nFrom CDC website: \"If you have one long-term, steady sex partner, there is a very low chance of giving HCV to that partner and you do not need to change your sexual practices. If you want to lower the small chance of spreading HCV to your sex partner, you may decide to use latex condoms. (The efficacy of latex condoms in preventing infection with HCV is unknown, but their proper use may reduce transmission.) Ask your doctor about having your sex partner tested.\"", "doctor_answer": "first of all HCV is cured now in over 50% of cases by modern therapy.  Some of your readers obviously are not very educated.  Secondly, HCV is probably never transmitted by kissing and rarely if ever transmitted sexually.  Indeed, if you check the CDC (center for disease control) website it recommends no special precautions for sexual contact amongst monogamous couples even if HCV test is positive.  I feel that HCV probably is transmitted RARELY via sexual transmission, but on the order of 1% of the time.  Hep B on the other hand is commonly transmitted sexually.

Oseltamivir blocks the action of neuraminidase (it is a neuraminidase inhibitor) thereby reducing the spread of influenza. By preventing the spread of virus from cell to cell, the symptoms and duration of influenza infection are reduced. On average, oseltamivir reduces the duration of symptoms by one and a half days if treatment is started within forty-eight hours after symptoms begin. \n\nGeneric Available: No \n\nPrescription: Yes \n\nPreparations: 75 mg tablets \n\nStorage: Store at room temperature, 15-30°C (59-86°F) \n\nPrescribed For: Oseltamivir is used for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza infection in adults who have had symptoms for no longer than two days. \n\nDosing: Oseltamivir is administered orally. The recommended dose is one tablet twice daily for five days. For the best results, treatment should begin as soon as symptoms develop. \n\nDrug Interactions: There are no known interactions between oseltamivir and other drugs. Oseltamivir does not interact with the flu vaccine. Therefore, vaccinated individuals can use oseltamivir and vice versa.. \n\nPregnancy: Oseltamivir has not been adequately evaluated in pregnant women. \n\nNursing Mothers: The use of oseltamivir in nursing mothers has not been evaluated. \n\nSide Effects: The most frequent side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bronchitis, abdominal pain, headache and dizziness. Administering oseltamivir after meals helps reduce nausea.\n\nRelated Links on MedicineNet.com\n\nPage 2 of this Article\nThe Doctor's Response\nInformation on this web site is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Consult your dentist and/or physician if the condition persists.\n\nIt is important to practice good oral hygiene, such as brushing and flossing your teeth at least twice a day. To alleviate the odor, clean your tongue with your toothbrush or a tongue scraper, a plastic tool that scrapes away bacteria that builds on the tongue. Chewing sugar-free gum also may help control the odor. If you have dentures or a removable appliance, such as a retainer or mouthguard, clean the appliance thoroughly before placing it back in your mouth. Before you use mouth rinses, deodorizing sprays or tablets, talk with your dentist because these products only mask the odor temporarily, and some products work better than others.", "doctor_answer": "Bad breath mainly comes from food particles stuck in your teeth, gums, and tongue.

It is classified as one of the nine \"essential\" amino acids because you need to get it from outside sources such as foods or supplements--in other words the body can't make it on its own.\n\n Researchers are exploring the value of lysine supplementation and the consumption of lysine-rich foods for lowering cholesterol, improving athletic performance, and enhancing recovery after surgery.\n\nSome nutritionally oriented physicians and dentists recommend taking lysine during an outbreak of canker sores to speed healing. The exact cause of these tiny but quite painful mouth ulcers is unclear, but most research indicates that a virus is responsible. However, there have been almost no clinical trials using lysine as a remedy for canker sores.\n\nThe most promising application of lysine is its use in managing and preventing painful and unsightly herpes sores caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).\n\nSpecifically, lysine may help to:\n\n# Prevent and relieve cold sores (herpes). Exciting research over the past several decades suggests that lysine may be helpful in controlling herpes simplex-related infections. There are two types of this virus: type 1, which typically causes cold sores or fever blisters around the mouth, and type 2, which tends to cause genital sores. However, both forms can cause eruptions around the mouth or on the genitals. Once infected with the virus, you have it permanently. It may lie dormant, but it doesn't go away. Outbreaks are usually painful and unsightly, as well as contagious.\n\nA few years ago, researchers discovered that in order to grow (replicate), the herpes virus needs arginine, another common amino acid. (Foods high in arginine include chocolate, peanuts, almonds, seeds, cereal grains, gelatin, and raisins.) Lysine competes with arginine for absorption and entry into tissue cells. And when lysine is present, it inhibits the growth of HSV by knocking out arginine.\n\nThis makes a diet high in lysine and low in arginine a useful tool in managing HSV infections. In a recent study, participants consumed large amounts of lysine (about 1 gram three times each day) while restricting food sources of arginine. A significant number of participants (74%) noticed an improvement in their HSV infections and a decrease in the number of outbreaks.\n\n-As a side note, broccoli is also one of the better vegetable to help your body in keeping outbreaks at bay.", "doctor_answer": "human sexual body parts\n\noh you may have already done that..sorry"}, {"question": "is there any medicine to remove the tattoo?", "patient_answer": "No, it has to be bleached out or even cut out.

When our ears get plugged from muscular tension, it can prevent them from draining properly, and be a contributing factor in the development of sinus and ear infections.

It works well on its own, but combined with yoga it can be a very effective and low cost way of eliminating pain and relaxing muscular tension.

This would be expected since analgesic and dependence effects are mediated by the same μ-opioid receptor.

Go to the doctors that specialize in cancer all across the USA.  They have their own cures.  To be honest, it can be cured, and with 90% survival rate if you dont have a level 3 cancer.  But, when doctors give up, you can still survive up to 80%.   Not only that, some remedies sold over the internet can even cure you with high survival rates.  Please read this.  I have written it for several yahooers battling cancer, but you should read it if you need.  Here goes:\n(To be honest, chemotherapy is not a cancer treatment. Here is the situation. Chemo can take care of the problem right away, but the doctor always says that, some can live an extended 2 years, or 3 years. And some die right away from the chemicals. This is with late stages of cancer. Now, for early stages, it helps the problem but your health is deteriorated. They say that chemo affects the cancer and your normal body cells. How many people you know, who have had late stages of cancer, and lived through it pass 5 yours with chemo therapy? I bet you that you have never even heard of it. Even if someone has, how many people is that compared to that masses? The problem with other medicines is that the pharmaceautical companies cannot control that product. What if it was tree bark say for instance. How many people do you know will buy the pills if they can just walk up to any tree and bite a piece off to save themselves? See? So, USA doctors are familiar with these remedies, but they do not talk about it. Try asking your doctor about green algae, or cesium chloride, or paw paw, etc etc. Then they start to talk. Otherwise, they wont say a word. And if you dont know, how can you ask? So, the doctors lips are sealed tight. The individual doctors on the other hand are sometimes scared to talk about it. It is because, if they open their mouths, they would be facing the whole medical community. Alot of them go into the medical field to help people, and some go in it for money. But, the top ranking ones in control are all in it for money. If not, they would have never gotten their position. I do not suggest you go with chemo therapy. You can look up some alternative medicine to cancer and they are all over the place on the net. The best ranked one is cesium chloride, paw paw, and along with others. Some health websites even have a place where you can go and tell them your stage of cancer and which type of cancer, and they will sell you a package based on your individual problem. There are also some doctors scattered all over the USA who specialize in cancer. You never hear about them right? Well, they wont be bothered by the medical community if they do a small operation without much advertising. But, they all report about 90% survival rates on cancers that regular cancer doctors give up on. And if that doctor didnt give up, do you expect to live anyways? No. I speak out to you because I dont want you to die like the two of my friends who have already died. Certain doctors even said that they could cure it with 80% survival rate. But, I didnt have the money to help them. So, I am speaking out in hopes that nothing happens to you and you survive. Regardless of your stage of cancer. Cesium chloride is what works best. Look it up, its everywhere. Even oxygen drops help. You can use them both at the same time. The thing is with these alternatives is that, some of them make you feel extremely bad at the beginning, but after a while you get used to it, and then you are gone with the cancer before you know it. So dont feel discouraged. Oxygen drops keep cancer from growing because your body can live with more oxygen. As a matter of fact, it helps circulate your blood. Cancer cannot live at the sight of oxygen. It has been said that not enough oxygen is what causes cancer. I dont know what the cause is, because there are many causes.

The following are the most common causes of those unattractive dark circles.\nHEREDITY\nLike varicose veins, dark circles under the eyes are usually an inherited trait. If you have dark circles, there is a good chance that others in your family also have them. The skin under the eye is very thin. When blood passes through the large veins close to the surface of the skin it can produce a bluish tint. The more transparent your skin, also an inherited trait, the darker the circles appear.\n\nEXPOSURE TO THE SUN\nEven in darker skinned people, exposure to sunlight, especially during the summer months, can cause a higher-than-normal level of skin pigmentation (melanin) under the eyes. People get sun tans because exposure to the sun increases the natural pigmentation of the skin and draws that pigmentation to the surface. The same principle applies to the skin under the eyes.\n\nALLERGIES, ASTHMA and ECZEMA\nAny condition that you have that causes your eyes to itch can contribute to darker circles under the eyes because rubbing or scratching the skin can darken the skin. Hay fever sufferers particularly will notice under-eye \"smudges\" during the height of the allergy season. Some food allergies can also cause the area under the eyes to appear darker.\n\nMEDICATIONS\nAny medications that you are taking that causes blood vessels to dilate, can cause circles under the eyes to darken. Because the skin under the eyes is very delicate, any increase blood flow shows through the skin.\n\nNUTRITION\nThe lack of nutrients in the diet, or the lack of a balance diet, can contribute to the discoloration of the area under the eyes.\n\nFATIGUE, LACK OF SLEEP\nA lack of sleep or excessive tiredness can cause paleness of the skin, which again allows the blood underneath the skin to become more visible and appear more blue or darker.\n\nPREGNANCY and MENSTRUATION\nThe skin can also become more pale during pregnancy and menstruation, which again allows the underlying veins under the eyes to become more visible.\n\nAGE\nIf you have a propensity to have dark circles under you eyes, as you grow older, they are likely to become more noticeable and permanent. Excess folds of skin under the eyes will also make dark circles more pronounced."}, {"question": "Do birthmarks move?", "patient_answer": "Birthmarks don't move from one location to another.They can grow,fade,or disappear.", "doctor_answer": "as you grow, they will more than likely move."}, {"question": "what is looked for in a 5dsp drug screening?", "patient_answer": "No matter what if you do drugs they find out in other ways instead of just that kind of test.

A total of about 50 million men have had a vasectomy--a number that corresponds to roughly 5 percent of all married couples of reproductive age. In comparison, about 15 percent of couples rely on female sterilization for birth control.\n\nApproximately half a million vasectomies are performed in the United States each year. About one out of six men over age 35 has been vasectomized. The prevalence of men undergoing the procedure increases with higher levels of education and income. Among married couples in the United States, only female sterilization and oral contraception are relied upon more often for family planning.\n\nHow is vasectomy done?\nIn the conventional approach, a physician makes one or two small incisions, or cuts, in the skin of the scrotum, which has been numbed with a local anesthetic. The vas is cut, and a small piece may be removed. Next, the doctor ties the cut ends and sews up the scrotal incision. The entire procedure is then repeated on the other side.\n\nRelated Links on MedicineNet.com \n\nPage 2 of this Article \nRelated Medical Procedures and Tests\nThe Doctor's Response\nInformation on this web site is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Vasectomy is a popular method of birth control: in 1983, figures showed that approximately 10 million men had been sterilized in the U.S. since 1969. Excision of the vas deferens is a minor surgical procedure that can be performed in a physician's office in less than half an hour. A small incision is made on one side of the scrotum (the external sac housing the testes) and the vas deferens is located, cut, and the ends tied off. The incision is closed and the procedure is repeated on the other side. After surgery, it is necessary to wait until a negative sperm count is obtained before discarding other means of contraception, because viable sperm cells are retained in the seminal vesicles (the pair of storage pouches where sperm is mixed with other components of semen) and along the various sperm ducts. In addition it is usually advised that the patient be reexamined after a year, because the severed ends of the vas deferens occasionally reknit. Sterility resulting from vasectomy is considered to be permanent, and attempts at surgically reversing vasectomy, called vasovasotomy, have had limited success. In India, where the government is trying to stem the tide of overpopulation, money is paid to men who submit to voluntary vasectomy. Efforts to overcome the irreversibility of vasectomy have also led to experimentation with the implantation of faucetlike devices that can be made to open or close the sperm duct in a simple operation. Such devices have functioned successfully in animals but are still considered experimental in humans because of their unproved reversibility, high cost, and the degree of surgical skill needed to implant them. Another option suggested to those undergoing vasectomy is to preserve their fertility by depositing semen in sperm banks.

Psychiatry defines these traits as a \"mental illness\", and promotes it as a \"disease\" that requires \"treatment\".\n\nIt is not a \"disease\", despite claims made in certain peoples answers here. There is NO credible scientific evidence that shows the existence of what constitutes \"schizophrenia\" as a biological/neurological disorder, brain abnormality or \"chemical imbalance\".\n\n\"For a disease to exist there must be a tangible, objective physical abnormality that can be determined by a test such as, but not limited to, blood or urine test, X-Ray, brain scan or biopsy. All reputable doctors would agree: No physical abnormality, no disease. In psychiatry, no test or brain scan exists to prove that a 'mental disorder' is a physical disease. Disingenuous comparisons between physical and mental illness and medicine are simply part of psychiatry's orchestrated but fraudulent public relations and marketing campaign.\" Fred A. Baughman Jr., MD (Neurologist, Pediatric Neurology), & Fellow at the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n\"Chemical imbalance…it’s a shorthand term really, it’s probably drug industry derived… We don’t have tests because to do it, you’d probably have to take a chunk of brain out of someone - not a good idea.\" Dr. Mark Graff, Chair of the Committee of Public Affairs for the American Psychiatric Association. July, 2005.\n\nSymptoms that psychiatry labels as \"schizophrenia\" (or it's related disorders), can stem from any number of variable sources. Many people have overcome disorders such as \"bipolar\" and \"schizophrenia\" through effective megavitamin therapy and effective nutrition. A growing wealth of evidence supports that underlying nutritional deficiencies can cause even the most severe mental disorders, including \"schizophrenia\". [1,2,3,4,5,6] \n\nYou may also be interested to know that the work undertaken by pioneers such as Dr. Lars Martensson and the late Dr. Loren Mosher show that there is also another way - far safer and more effective than psychiatric restraint, drugs and electro-shocks. For over a decade Loren R Mosher, MD, held a central position in American psychiatric research. He was the first Chief of the Center for Studies of Schizophrenia at the National Institute of Mental Health, 1969-1980. He founded the Schizophrenia Bulletin and for ten years he was its Editor-in-Chief. He also led the Soteria Project, which demonstrated that effective rehabilitation is possible without harmful antipsychotic drugs. Soteria provided a safe and sane environment where schizophrenic patients could stay, medication-free, with a young, nonprofessional staff trained to listen to and understand them and provide companionship. The idea was that schizophrenia can often be overcome with the help of meaningful relationships, rather than with drugs, and that such treatment would eventually lead to unquestionably healthier lives. The results were fantastic. Over just 6 weeks, patients recovered as quickly as those treated with medication in hospitals. [7,8] \n\nBottom line? Psychiatry is a belief-system, a \"faith\", not a science. Despite the huge marketing strategies, the so-called \"research\" and all the propaganda thrown at the world, there is not one iota of scientific evidence that proves that \"schizophrenia\" or ANY mental illness, in fact, exists as an actual --medical disease--.\n\nIf you have been told differently then know this: You have been lied to.\n\nFor more information, please visit:\n\nhttp://groups.msn.com/psychbusters\nDecoding Psychiatric Propaganda\n\nSee also http://www.alternativementalhealth.com/articles/default.htm#S\n\nAnd http://www.webcom.com/thrive/schizo/", "doctor_answer": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disease.

That’s the worst thing you can do in a diet because it slows down your metabolism and your body starts getting more fat from your food intake since, fat is the bodies fastest and easiest type of nutrition[not the healthiest though]. The reason this happen is because this helped us when we were no doing so good as hunters and gathers to keep us alive a bit longer. \n\nBefore I continue let me explain protein, carbohydrates, and fats.\n\nProtein is easiest described as anything that comes from or was an animal such chicken, fish, sirloin, and milk. \n\nCarbohydrates [carbs] can be found almost in anything else even apples.\nGood carbs:\nApples, wheat bread, sourdough bread, grains, and wheat \nBad carbs:\nWhite bread, hamburger buns, hotdog buns, Doritos, and sodas!\n\nGood fats:\nAvocados, pecans, almonds, and peanut butter \n\nThe ratio in your diet varies but I think a good starting point is something like\n[50%Protien:40%Carbs:10%fat]\n\nThis can sound meaningless. So in plain terms consume only good fats [portioned] and you should be okay.  Something like a handful of almonds, or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [separately. not consecutively]. \n\nThe reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because you are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [Proteins are 4 calories, Carbs are 4 calories, Fats are 9 calories] so theoretically if you eat less fats and more proteins you will have a less appetite because you will eat more. \n\nAnother nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself. That’s how the Adkins basically works. If you consume more proteins and less carbs you will lose weight. I leave to you to decide if this is good you.\n\nI would also advice you to split up your day into 5 meals. [warning: it will feel weird because you are not used to eating this decreased amount. Just keep in mind that you will eat in 3 hour and you will quickly noticed that you will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry] if you do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla.\n\nYou are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [if you have been starving yourself or if you don’t exercise].", "doctor_answer": "A  balanced diet.

Sometimes you need to do more to get the help you need than just do online research. \nThe best advice that I have is to talk to your doctor to work up an individualized treatment plan for your diabetes. Not everyone's diabetes works the same do the uniqueness of the human body and differences from person to person. \nAlso, seek out your local public health resources for valuable (and usually free of charge) education relating to diabetes. Your local health department would be a great place to start your search for resources. \n\nSome basic diabetes pointers:\n-- Eat a healthy diet. Reduce your sugar intake to minimal (not nonexistent though -- you have to have some sugar to have energy), low fat, low carb, etc. Also, pay special attention to your portion sizes at meals. Even eating too much of some health-conscious foods can be harmful to your blood sugar levels. Consider talking to a dietician.\n-- Take your medications regularly. Try to take them around the same time every day to maintain constant, consistent levels in your system. Only take the dosage prescribed. Don't alter your dose to self-treat high / low sugar levels. \n-- Monitor your blood sugars at home on a daily basis. (I usually monitor first thing in the morning and 2 hours after each meal, but talk to your doctor and see what he / she wants  you to do as far as a monitoring schedule goes.)\n-- Exercise. Getting out and moving around, walking, running, etc. are all great for helping keep a check on your blood sugar levels. Some resources do say, however, that if you do a self-check on your sugar and get a level of 300 or more, DO NOT exercise. Talk to you doctor and get his / her recommendation for your exercise plan. \n\nIt basically all comes down to you as to how well you manage your diabetes.

It shows how well blood flows to the heart muscle. It's usually done along with an exercise stress test on a treadmill or bicycle.\n\nThe thallium stress test is useful to determine:\n\nExtent of a coronary artery blockage\nPrognosis of patients who've suffered a heart attack\nEffectiveness of cardiac procedures done to improve circulation in coronary arteries\nCause(s) of chest pain\nLevel of exercise that a patient can safely perform\nWhen the patient reaches his or her maximum level of exercise, a small amount of a radioactive substance called thallium is injected into the bloodstream. Then the patient lies down on a special table under a camera (\"gamma camera\") that can see the thallium and make pictures. The thallium mixes with the blood in the bloodstream and heart's arteries and enters heart muscle cells. If a part of the heart muscle doesn't receive a normal blood supply, less than a normal amount of thallium will be in those heart muscle cells.\n\nThe first pictures are made shortly after the exercise test and show blood flow to the heart during exercise. The heart is \"stressed\" during the exercise test -- thus the name \"stress test.\" The patient then lies quietly for 2-3 hours and another series of pictures is made. These show blood flow to the heart muscle during rest.", "doctor_answer": "Your doctor will generally order a Thallium Stress Test to look for certain conditions in your heart. \n\nThis is a scintillation scan (gamma camera or photoscan) involving the use of thallium-201, a radioisotope.

Since the heart can pump blood into the large arteries more quickly than it can be absorbed and released by the tiny arterioles and capillaries, considerable inner pressure always exists in the arteries. The contraction of the heart (systole) causes the blood pressure to rise to its highest point, and relaxation of the heart (diastole) brings the pressure down to its lowest point.\nBlood pressure is strongest in the aorta, where the blood leaves the heart. It diminishes progressively in the smaller blood vessels and reaches its lowest point in the veins (see circulatory system).

Diabetics may also find it necessary to monitor their blood-sugar levels on a regular basis. Low blood-sugar levels indicate that a person should immediately eat candy or some other sweet snack. Insulin pumps are also effective in maintaining the proper level of blood sugar. These pumps can be implanted under the skin and programmed to continuously release the correct amount of insulin.\nIdiopathic Hypoglycemia\n\nIdiopathic hypoglycemia can usually be controlled by learning and following certain dietary rules. These rules include the following:\n\n    * Avoid overeating.\n    * Never skip breakfast.\n    * Include protein in all meals and snacks.\n    * Limit intake of fats, refined sugar, and processed foods.\n    * Become familiar with the sugar content in different kinds of vegetables and grain products.\n    * Keep a food diary that can be used to predict which foods produce the symptoms of hypoglycemia.\n    * Eat a regular but limited amount of fresh fruits.\n    * Follow a diet that is high in fiber.", "doctor_answer": "If I recall, Insulin shock occurs when your blood sugar drops dramatically.

Ancient Greek and Roman literature even discusses primitive toothpicks that were chewed on to help clean the teeth and mouth.\n\nAs the years passed, toothpicks matured into the chew stick which was about the size of a modern pencil. One end was chewed into and became softened and brush-like while the opposite end was pointed and used as a pick to clean food and debris from between the teeth. The twigs used were carefully chosen from aromatic trees that had the ability to clean and freshen the mouth. The earliest literature showing the use of these twigs is found in Chinese literature at around 1600 BC.\n\nThe first true bristled toothbrush also originated in China at around 1600 AD. At around 1780, the first toothbrush was made by William Addis of Clerkenald, England. Addis, and later, his descendants, manufactured the finest English brushes, where the handles were carved out of the bone of cattle and the heads of the natural bristles were placed in the bored holes made in the bone and kept in place by thin wire. The natural bristles were obtained from the necks and shoulders of swine, especially from pigs living in colder climates like Siberia and China.\n\nBy the early 1800s the bristled brushes were in general use in Europe and Japan. In 1857, H. N. Wadsworth was credited as the first American to receive a toothbrush patent as America entered the growing toothbrush market. In 1844, the first toothbrush was manufactured by hand and patented as a 3-row brush of serrated bristles with larger tufts by Dr. Meyer L. Rhein. In 1885, the Florence Manufacturing Company of Massachusetts, in association with Dr.Rhein, began producing the Pro-phy-lac-tic brush for mass marketing in the United States.\n\nAs technology progressed, synthetic bristles replaced the natural swine bristles. Nylon was first applied to the toothbrush at around 1938 and by 1939, electric toothbrushes arrived in an attempt to offer the public a brush that could simulate the action of a manual brush but with better results and cleaning performance.\n\nHard to believe, but most Americans didn't brush their teeth until soldiers brought the Army's enforced habit back home from World War II. The first real electric toothbrush was produced in 1939, developed in Switzerland. The electrical toothbrush was first marketed in the United States in 1960 by Squibb. The brush was called the Broxodent. General Electric introduced a rechargeable cordless toothbrush in 1961.

The term comes from a Greek word meaning \"membrane\", and is also the name of the classical Greek god of marriage.\nBecause sexual activity would usually tear this membrane, its presence has been considered a guarantor of virginity in societies that place a high value on female chastity before marriage. However, the hymen is a poor indicator of whether a woman has actually engaged in coitus, because the tissue may be torn or stretched through masturbation, or tampon use and other non-sexual acts before having sexual intercourse. Also, some females with intact hymens have had sexual intercourse.\n\nThe size and shape of this opening (or openings) vary greatly from person to person. Some women are born with no hymen at all, while others have a closed or imperforate hymen. These women may require a gynecologist to perform a medical procedure called a hymenotomy to allow menstrual products to escape. Still other women have unusually thick hymens that may require a hymenotomy to prevent pain for the woman during sex.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymen\nHYMEN \nA thin piece of skin that stretches over the opening of the vagina. There is a small opening in it to let blood flow out of the vagina during a period. People used to think that a HYMEN that wasn't broken meant a girl was a virgin. Now we know that it has a small hole in it that can get stretched more just from running, playing or using tampons. Some girls are even born without a HYMEN. \nhttp://www.teensource.org/RunScript.asp?page=174&word=h&Poll_ID=4&p=ASP&#92;Pg174.asp\n\nHymen is also an alternate name for the Greek god Hymenaios.", "doctor_answer": "This is definitely a question for your ob/gyn.

Smoking while wearing a patch is dangerous and may lead to stroke or heart attack.\n      Use of the patch requires abstinence from tobacco products...i.e. no smoking or chewing tobacco.\n\n      Cost\n      Patches are expensive and cost close to $100 per month of use.\n      However bear in mind that smoking 1 ppd costs $1000 per year, which multipied by 10 years approximates the price of a car.\n      Some people are tempted to cut the patch to save money. Nicoderm is the only patch that can be cut without destroying the patch's ability to deliver nicotine through the skin to the bloodstream reliably.. It is not unsafe to cut the other patches as far as I know. However cutting the other patches impairs the transdermal drug delivery system, and may not provide reliable blood levels of nicotine. the key word here is reliable.\n\n      The total dose of nicotine in the patch does not correlate at a milligram to milligram equivalency to the dose delivered to the bloodstream. The drug delivery system of the patch ensures that nicotine is transported thru the skin at a constant rate, and e ach manufacturer uses a different patented technology to do this. Only a portion of the total nicotine contained in the patch is transported thru the skin. Individual differences in skin thickness, location of the applied patch, and other related factors play a role in the total dose delivered.\n      3 Step Tapering Method of using the patch\n          o The 21 mg patch is worn daily for 6-8 weeks for quitters who smoked an average of 1 ppd ( 2 ppd quitters may require 2 patches to alleviate cravings and withdrawal symptoms)\n          o The 14 mg patch is then worn daily for the next 2 to 4 weeks if the ex smoker remains confident in his or her ability to not smoke and if urges or cravings to smoke are controlled.\n          o The 7 mg patch is then worn for 2-4 weeks if the same criteria as above are met.\n          o In the absence of cravings and urge to smoke the patch is then stopped entirely.\n\n      It is important to individualize the tapering method . . . Some people require longer periods of use, others shorter. If cravings intensify , return to the next higher dose of the patch.\n\n      Types of nicotine patches\n            Nicotrol\n            15,10,5 mg 16 hour patches", "doctor_answer": "TRY THIS:\n\nDON\"T JOIN OR LET COME NEAR YOUR FIRST TWO FINGURES!"}, {"question": "i have almost continual hot flashes and am 67 years old, anyone else??", "patient_answer": "yes!!!

Commonly occurs at pressure points eg. elbows,knees,knuckles as well as scalp, trunk, arms & legs, external sex organs & less commonly it may erupt suddenly all over the body. In psoriasis, skin cells reproduce many times faster than normal & live only 3/4 days;the dead cells build up on the skin, forming thick,flaky patches. It is not an infection, & not contagious. It may be inherited; climate change, skin injury, infection, drug reaction, stress etc. can flare it up or worsen it.It is a chronic disease i.e. it can last a long time & can come back frequently.\n\nEczema is also a chronic skin disorder that causes an intensely icthy, red, raised rash; may make the skin dry & flaky. Sometimes itchy blisters form , when they burst or when scratching damage the skin, the surface may be left moist & crusty. It's not contagious. Commonest cause is general allergic over sensitivity, common in people with asthma or hay fever.

Lindane is a cousin of DDT and can harm the nervous system. Natural and safer alternatives include one percent permethrin cream rinse, sold as Nix and Neem, derived from a tree in India. Lice can develop resistance to permethrin products, and these products can aggravate asthma in some children, but both are relatively nontoxic. (Neem is sold in garden shops.)\n\nI've also heard that some California school systems are using a product called Lice-B-Gone, a non-toxic, multi-enzyme shampoo made from plant sources that seems to get rid of lice in a single application. It works by softening the glue that holds the nits (lice eggs) to the hair shaft and also dissolves the exoskeletons of adult lice. Since it contains no pesticides, Lice-B-Gone is considered safe for pregnant women, nursing mothers, young children and people with asthma.\n\nThe comb mentioned by the earlier poster is helpful.\n\nAlso, you really need to wash all pillows, sheets, towels and bedding in hot water to rid them of the lice eggs.", "doctor_answer": "Nix (permethrin 1% creme rinse). \nRid, Pronto, A-200, R&C, Triple X, or Barc (shampoos and gels with pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide). \nIf these don't work you might need a prescription medication."}, {"question": "Have you ever stopped taking lithium?

Sleeping likely simulates your basil metabolism.\n\nYou can gain weight when your caloric intake is greater than what you burn off.  But it is slightly more complicated.

This condition shows a particular pattern of inheritance. Not nearly as common as the other types of depressive disorders, bipolar disorder involves cycles of depression and mania, or elation. Bipolar disorder is often a chronic, recurring condition. Sometimes, the mood switches are dramatic and rapid, but most often they are gradual.\n\nWhen in the depressed cycle, the person can experience any or all of the symptoms of a depressive disorder. When in the manic cycle, any or all of the symptoms listed under mania may be experienced. Mania often affects thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that cause serious problems and embarrassment. For example, unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is in a manic phase.\n\nA significant variant of bipolar disorder is designated as bipolar II. (The usual form of bipolar disorder is referred to as bipolar I.) Bipolar II is a syndrome in which the affected person has repeated depressive episodes punctuated by what is called hypomania (mini-highs).

The word 'herpes' was used by Hippocrates to describe lesions that 'creep' or 'crawl.'  Although previously well characterized, it was not until 1893 that the transmissibility was recognized.6\n\nThe herpes family of viruses currently is thought to consist of herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex 2 (HSV-2), varicella-zoster, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, and human herpes virus VI, VII, and VIII.5  All are capable of entering and replicating in epithelial cells, while some of the herpes family is neurotropic and others are lymphotropic.  HSV-1 and HSV-2 are neurotropic, infecting sensory nerve fibers and have been demonstrated to reproduce in epithelial cells.  HSV-1 and HSV-2 are lytic to human epithelial cells and latent in neural tissue at the site of regional ganglions.  Usually the virus initially enters the body through a break in the mucous membrane integrity, although there is evidence that it may penetrate intact skin.  In either case, transmission results from mucocutaneous contact with infected secretions and aerosols.  When reactivated, the virus travels along the nerve axon to the surface epithelial cells and can cause a recurrent epithelial outbreak.\n\n\nhttp://www.thejcdp.com/issue009/tilliss/10tillis.htm", "doctor_answer": "Herpes is a virus, which is the reason that, unlike love, herpes is forever."}, {"question": "i have a friend with down syndromw and i go with him and his respit worker on staurdays-please answer?", "patient_answer": "I would go if I were you .Your condition alough painful is not life threatning and downs children are very loving and need routine .So go.", "doctor_answer": "i would go and then when i get back i would make and appt. to see if your tail bone is broken"}, {"question": "can you spred herpies if you do not have eany outbreakes and take acyclovir two times a day?", "patient_answer": "Yes. \nA person is considered contagious when prodromal symptoms, active sores, and healing lesions are present, however herpes can be potentially contagious when no symptoms are present.

Delve into your daily fluid needs to learn how your body uses water and what factors may increase — or decrease — your water requirements.\n\n\nHealth benefits of water\n\nWater is crucial to your health. It makes up, on average, 60 percent of your body weight. Every system in your body depends on water.\n\n\n\nLack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry on normal functions. Even mild dehydration — as little as a 1 percent to 2 percent loss of your body weight — can sap your energy and make you tired. Dehydration poses a particular health risk for the very young and the very old. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include:\n\nExcessive thirst \nFatigue \nHeadache \nDry mouth \nLittle or no urination \nMuscle weakness \nDizziness \nLightheadedness \n\nHow much water do you need?\n\nEvery day you lose water through sweating — noticeable and unnoticeable — exhaling, urinating and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you need to replace this water by consuming beverages and foods that contain water. So how much water, or more precisely fluid, do you need?\n\nThis isn't an easy question to answer. A healthy adult's daily fluid intake can vary widely. Most people drink fluid to quench thirst, to supply perceived water needs and \"out of habit.\" At least three approaches estimate total fluid (water) needs for healthy, sedentary adults living in a temperate climate.\n\nReplacement approach. The average urine output for adults is 1.5 liters a day. You lose close to an additional liter of water a day through breathing, sweating and bowel movements. Food usually accounts for 20 percent of your fluid intake, so you if you consume 2 liters of water or other beverages a day (a little more than 8 cups), along with your normal diet, you can replace the lost fluids. \nEight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Another approach to water intake is the \"8 x 8 rule\" — drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day (about 1.9 liters). The rule could also be stated, \"drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day,\" as all fluids count toward the daily total. Though this approach isn't supported by scientific evidence, many people use this basic rule as a guideline for how much water and other fluids to drink. \nDietary recommendations. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day and women consume 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages a day. These guidelines are based on national food surveys that assessed people's average fluid intakes. \nYou can choose any of these fluid intake approaches to gauge your fluid needs. But your current total fluid intake is probably OK if you drink enough water to quench your thirst, produce a colorless or slightly yellow normal amount of urine, and feel well.\n\n\nFactors that influence water needs\n\nYou may need to modify total fluid intake from these recommended amounts depending on several factors, including how active you are, the climate, your health status, and if you're pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\nExercise. If you exercise or engage in any activity that makes you sweat, you'll need to drink extra water to compensate for that fluid loss. Drink 2 cups of water two hours before a long endurance event, for example, a marathon or half-marathon. One to 2 cups of water is also adequate for shorter bouts of exercise. During the activity, replenish fluids at regular intervals, and continue drinking water or other fluids after you&", "doctor_answer": "About 1.5 to 2litres per day is required in the form of fluids.

Some patients have benefitted, while others have found their medications seemed to make little difference. This variation in treatment outcome and the resulting lack of consensus regarding the drug(s) of choice reflects in part an uncertainty with strategy. While doctors can’t say with precision what causes the disorder in each individual case, there does seem to be a common disease-producing process in all men. Yet where, in this complex spectrum extending from early wound healing to late scar formation, do we intervene with medications? This question remains a topic of clinical research. \n\nIn general, changes in tissue elasticity that accompany the inflammation of early Peyronie’s disease are reversible, whereas the loss of elasticity associated with the end-stage scarring characteristic of the later illness is not. Since it is a consequence of local change in elasticity, bending responds best to medical therapy in the early stage, a period that generally lasts about six months. \n\nIn order to evaluate medical treatments, we should know how a case of Peyronie’s disease evolves on its own, in the absence of therapy. Understanding this so-called natural history of the disease provides a basis for comparison, and a means for deciding when surgical intervention may be appropriate. During the intial six months of the disorder, erections can be painful. Eventually, even in the absence of treatment, the pain usually goes away. Unfortunately, bending does not always follow the same pattern. Though it may improve or resolve spontaneously in a minority of men, most untreated men with Peyronie’s disease will retain some degree of penile distortion. Most medical treatments have a success rate of about 60% in improving bending. Some factors associated with a tendency for bending to persist are: the presence of dupuytren’s contractures, the presence of heavy plaque calcification, and the presence of severe (greater than 45 degrees) curvature.\n\nSome of the contemporary medications in use are: \n\nVITAMIN E: this anti-oxidant has other uses in the treatment of scars, and has been employed in the treatment of Peyronie’s disease since 1945. \nPOTABA or potassium para amino benzoate is designated by the FDA as \"possibly effective\". Large doses are required, which may cause intestinal upset. \nCOLCHICINE is a medication used for many years in the treatment of gout. It acts against inflammation, and interferes with the manufacture of scar tissue. \nVERAPAMIL is usually given by direct injection into the plaque. It also interferes with the synthesis of scar tissue precursors. \nCOLLAGENASE is an investigational drug that enzymatically digests scar. \nSurgical Treatment:\n\nWho should consider an operation?\n\nCandidates for surgery should fufill four basic criteria. First and foremost is severity. The risks and expense of an operation only make sense when bending or deformity is severe enough to seriously interfere with sexual function. Secondly, natural healing or spontaneous resolution should have been given an opportunity. This is usually accomplished by deferring the decision for surgery at least twelve months from the time of onset. During this time the third criteria can be satisfied - an adequete trial of some form of medical therapy. Finally, no operation should be done on a man whose condition is changing, either for the better or worse. The best surgical outcomes are in men with stable (unchanging) condition.\n\nWhat are the risks of surgery?\n\nUnfortunately, surgery does not offer a cure for Peyronie’s disease. The scarring in men with deformity severe and persistant enough to warrant an operation represents an irreversible loss of connective tissue elasticity. Though surgical restoration of sexual function can be both effective and reliable, potential candidates need to understand the compromise inh", "doctor_answer": "Treatment: \nI. a). Mild Curvature with good erections - no treatment is needed unless the patient insists on cosmetic improvement. This is handled by (1) making the long side shorter, with a series of plication sutures or, (2) making the short side longer by incising the plaque transversely. Usually nothing further is needed; a tissue graft is rarely necessary. \n\nI. b). Mild curvature with poor erections - The erectile dysfunction is the chief problem here and can be treated by the intra-urethral pellet, Muse; Viagra; or a penile prosthesis. Intracavernosal self-injection theoretically could make the curvature worse, so I prefer to avoid it. Experience suggests that in these patients erectile dysfunction often worsens faster than might otherwise be expected. The penile prosthesis is an attractive option in these cases. \n\nII. a). Moderate to severe curvature with good erections - here the curvature is the problem. This is treated by making the short side longer or the long side shorter. The latter tends to shorten the penis, and patients do not happily accept a shorter penis. Therefore, the short side is made longer by exposing the plaque and making a series of short elliptical transverse incisions through the plaque down to, but not into, the spongy tissue, making the plaque discontinuous - dividing it into disconnected segments - allows the penis to expand symmetrically on erection. To do this it may be necessary to elevate the neurovascular bundle. Temporary, patchy sensory loss may occur postoperatively but I have never seen it permanent, or even last longer than 3 months. \n\nII. b). Moderate to severe curvature with poor erections - the penile prosthesis has been very successful with these patients. Just by inflating the prosthesis alone, adequate straightening may occur. Often inflating the prosthesis by manually \"molding\" the penis gently but firmly bending it opposite the curve - additional straightening can nearly always be obtained. If still more straightening is needed, an incision is made and the plaque exposed and incised or excised. \n\nIn those patients whose disease has left them with unacceptable shortening, we have obtained highly satisfactory results by combining the above procedures with a lengthening procedure. Significant length gain can be obtained in this manner. \n\nPatients can go home the same day or the next day. Intercourse can take place in 6 weeks. Complications can include bleeding, infection, numbness, shortening, inadequate curvature correction, discomfort lasting more than a few days. We have never seen permanent sensory loss, worsening of erections, or ejaculatory problems. \n\nIt is important for patients to understand that while penile curvature can be markedly improved and erectile function restored, once the patient has Peyronie's disease, his penis will never be the same as before the disease developed."}, {"question": "I have some serious burining and itching \"down below\" and im a female what could this be and how do i resolve?", "patient_answer": "May be a yeast infection.

The virus travels through tiny breaks in the skin or through moist areas, but symptoms may not appear for up to a month or more after infection. Transmission was thought to be most common during an active outbreak, however in the early 1980s scientists and doctors realized that the virus can be shed from the skin in the absence of symptoms. It is estimated that between 50 and 80% of new HSV-2 cases are from asymptomatic viral shedding.\n\nHSV asymptomatic shedding is believed to occur on 2.9% of days while on antiviral therapy, versus 10.8% of days without. Shedding is known to be more frequent within the first 12 months of acquiring HSV-2. There are some indications that some individuals may have much lower patterns of shedding, but evidence supporting this is not fully supported. Sex should always be avoided in the presence of symptomic lesions.\n\nWomen are more susceptible to acquiring genital HSV-2 than men. On an annual basis, without the use of antivirals or condoms, the transmission risk from infected male to female is approximately 8-10%. This is believed to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites. Transmission risk from infected female to male is approximately 4-5% annually. Supressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios by about 50%, meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom free. Condom use also reduces the transmission risk by 50%. Condom use is much more effective at preventing male to female transmission than vice-versa. (Wald et al., 2001) The effects of combining antiviral and condom use is roughly additive, thus resulting in approximately a 75% combined reduction in annual transmission risk.

Skin is the only organ that is constantly exposed to potential irritation. And, with so many things coming into contact with your skin daily, you're bound to get an itch or two. Serious itching can be caused by allergies, disease, emotions and infections, but let's take a look at what causes the common itches that aggravate you everyday. \nItching, also known as pruritus, starts with some kind of external stimuli, including bugs, dust, clothing fibers and hair. Like tickling, itching is a built-in defense mechanism that alerts your body to the potential of being harmed. In this case, it might be the potential of being bit by a bug. \n\nWhen the stimuli lands on your skin, it may not bother you at first, but soon it will begin to rub back and forth across your skin. Once the hair or dust scratches your skin's surface layer, receptors in the dermis of the skin will become irritated. In a split second, these receptors send a signal through fibers in the skin to your spinal cord and then up to the cerebral cortex in your brain. \n\nThe same fibers that send itching signals are also used to send pain signals to the brain, which once led some scientists to believe that itching was a form of light pain. That notion has since been dispelled by research, which showed that pain and itching elicit opposite responses. Pain causes us to withdraw and itching causes us to scratch. \n\nAs soon as we feel an itch, our first natural response is to scratch the spot of the itch with our fingernails. The reason for this response is simple -- we want to remove the irritant as soon as possible. Once you've scratched the area of irritation, you are likely to feel some relief. When your brain realizes that you've scratched away the irritant, the signal being sent to your brain that you have an itch is interrupted and therefore no longer recognized by the brain. \n\nEven if you don't remove the irritant, scratching will at least cause pain and divert your attention away from the itching. The irritant that caused the itching is very small, maybe only a few microns in length, so it disturbs only a few nerve endings. When you use your fingernail to scratch the spot where the irritant is, you not only remove the irritant but you irritate a lot more nerve endings than the irritant.", "doctor_answer": "huh! i thought it was the release of histamine by the injured cells.how silly of me."}, {"question": "how to reduce weight?", "patient_answer": "I found eating less food and more moving around.ALSO THE ONLY DIET THAT WORKED FOR ME WAS WEGHT WATCHERS AND THE SLIMFAST DIET.", "doctor_answer": "There's lots of diets, and people swear by certain ones, but I think it's pretty simple.

Often, if they develop signs of an infection such as fever, infants have to receive antibiotics and be admitted to the hospital.\n\n          o The elderly population, especially those with other medical illnesses such as diabetes, may be at increased risk as well.\n\nMany different microbes can cause sepsis. Although bacteria are most commonly the cause, viruses and fungi can also cause sepsis. Infections in the lungs (pneumonia), bladder and kidneys (urinary tract infections), skin (cellulitis), abdomen (such as appendicitis), and other organs (such as meningitis) can spread and lead to sepsis.

Every person is individual, so you will have to go by trial and error, but here is some of what I do...\n\n1. Take an antidepressant. I've tried many prescribed by my doctor and found that even St.John's Wort works very well.  The antidepressants raise your seretonin levels, (the feel good chemical in your brain,) and you just generally feel better all over.\n\n2. Get some exercise every day. Not too little, but not too much.  Too little will allow your muscles to become stiff and sore but too much will make them ache like crazy.  I find yoga and walking to be the two best exercises for me. I do them every day and my body feels 1000% better.\n\n3. Eat a healthier diet.  Too much sugar, white flour, fat and carbs, seem to exasperate the condition.  Try to stick to natural foods, whole grains, fresh fruit and vegetables.\n\n4. Get enough sleep and rest.  Try to get 8 hours of sleep each night if possible. If you have what I do, and wake up each night and toss and turn, try taking a herbal sleep remedy.  Valerian and passionflower worked very well for me. They sell sleep remedy blends in health food stores and I find they really help. \n\n5.  Mediation and relaxation...even if it's only for 5 minutes a day, will make a big difference.  I know you said you have 4 children, and I have 5, all boys, so I know it's really hard to get any time to meditate or relax, but it's really, really, important if you are going to be any good to them.  You have to take care of yourself.\n\n6. Journalling. Again, I know this takes time, but it is the best way to get your feelings out of you.  If you don't have someone you can share you feeling with, then write about them.  Holding all your feelings inside causes a lot of tension, and I believe that's where and how Fibromyalgia starts.  Once I started writing, and crying, releasing some of my pain and withheld emotions, I really started feeling better.\n\nI wish you all the best of luck. You are living with a difficult chronic condition.  Take good care of yourself.  That's always the best place to start.\n\nTake care.\n\nKathy", "doctor_answer": "In my experience pain medications do not work. My best advise is make sure to get plenty of sleep, take a multiple vitamin, keep active in at least low impact sports, and consider Magnesium and Malic Acid supplements (consult the doctor or a nutritionist to have your Magnesuim level checked- it is a simpe mouth swab and not painful), meditation does help some in keeping the pain back if you can seperate your mind from the pain, and try to take 2-3 warm Epson Salt baths a week (Epson salt contains Magnesium and soaking in a warm tub of it helps to get the mineral into the body. Magnesium aids the muscles in using oxygen and when the level is low which is typical in Fibro it can cause are cramps, spasms, and pain.) Also, Fibromyalgia is a neurotransmitter disorder certain foods can trigger similiar symptoms to Fibro. Try eliminating Monsodium Glutamate from your diet. I did and some of my symptoms (chronic headaches and nausea) went away. It is in everything from Doritos to chicken soup. A few key finding's of an FDA study found MSG to cause a \"burning sensation in the back of the neck, forearms and chest\".\nIt's not a wonder that you are having problems concentrating, stress, and anxiety.

While certain foods may promote stone formation in people who are susceptible, scientists do not believe that eating any specific food causes stones to form in people who are not susceptible.\n\nA person with a family history of kidney stones may be more likely to develop stones. Urinary tract infections, kidney disorders such as cystic kidney diseases, and certain metabolic disorders such as hyperparathyroidism are also linked to stone formation.\n\nIn addition, more than 70 percent of people with a rare hereditary disease called renal tubular acidosis develop kidney stones.\n\nCystinuria and hyperoxaluria are two other rare, inherited metabolic disorders that often cause kidney stones. In cystinuria, too much of the amino acid cystine, which does not dissolve in urine, is voided. This can lead to the formation of stones made of cystine. In patients with hyperoxaluria, the body produces too much of the salt oxalate. When there is more oxalate than can be dissolved in the urine, the crystals settle out and form stones.\n\n \nShapes of various stones. Sizes are usually smaller than shown here.\n \nHypercalciuria is inherited. It is the cause of stones in more than half of patients. Calcium is absorbed from food in excess and is lost into the urine. This high level of calcium in the urine causes crystals of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate to form in the kidneys or urinary tract.\n\nOther causes of kidney stones are hyperuricosuria which is a disorder of uric acid metabolism, gout, excess intake of vitamin D, urinary tract infections, and blockage of the urinary tract. Certain diuretics which are commonly called water pills or calcium-based antacids may increase the risk of forming kidney stones by increasing the amount of calcium in the urine.\n\nCalcium oxalate stones may also form in people who have a chronic inflammation of the bowel or who have had an intestinal bypass operation, or ostomy surgery. As mentioned above, struvite stones can form in people who have had a urinary tract infection.

Hypotension and shock may require early administration of vasopressors and hemodynamic monitoring with attention to fluid and electrolyte balance, circulatory volume, and blood pressure. Viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) patients tend to respond poorly to fluid infusions and rapidly develop pulmonary edema.\n\nPatient caregivers require barrier infection control measures including double gloves, impermeable gowns, face shields, eye protection, and leg and shoe coverings.\n\nA few research groups are working on drugs and vaccines to fight the virus. In 2002, Genphar, a company doing research for the United States Army's biodefense program, announced that an experimental vaccine protected animals from a high dose of Marburg virus. The tests were conducted by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). According to the company, all animals in the control group died within days whereas all animals that received the regular dosage of the vaccine were fully protected. The company has moved on to non-human primate trials. [4] Late in 2003, the US government awarded the company a contract worth $8.4 million for what was described as \"a multivalent Ebola, Marburg filovirus vaccine program\".\n\nIn June 2005 scientists at Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory announced that they had also developed vaccines for both Marburg and Ebola that showed significant promise in primate testing. Studies on mice also suggested that the vaccine might be an effective treatment for the disease if it is administered shortly after a patient is infected. To make the vaccines the scientists fused a surface protein from the viruses they hope to protect against onto an animal virus - vesicular stomatitis - which is thought to be of no threat to humans.

The only way I could effectively keep my weight down was to find way that I really enjoyed that would burn off those calories. My friend turned me on to boxing. Not kick boxing aerobics (not that theres anything wrong with that) but it was training with a real boxing trainer. Three times a week I would go into the gym for an hour and half and cover my self in abaleen (makes you sweat more) and then put on a sauna suit and get in the ring. He would hold mits and make me punch until my arms could punch anymore. He would put me through the same kind of training as he would if I was training to really fight. (Even though I have no intention of ever doing that) We would weigh in at the beginning of every work out and then again at the end and on average you left about 1 to 2 pounds lighter from sweating so much. It was an amazing stress releaser, and very cool from a self defense aspect as well. sorry to get off on a tangent about boxing as boxing isn't for everyone but my point was find a way to work out that you enjoy and that doesn't feel like a chore.

While these tests can't determine if it's cancer for sure, they can and do show some lumps to be non-cancerous, which will prevent some unnecessary biopsies.  If the tests don't rule out cancer, then a biopsy is the only way to know for sure what it is.\n\nFollow your doctor's advice, and good luck with everything.", "doctor_answer": "To my knowledge, that's the only way they can test it to find what it's made of. X-rays, ultrasounds and mammagrams only show that there's something there. If you have a lump, don't mess around...get it tested. Finding out now could save your life!

What is less accurate are the calorie outputs displayed on fitness machines.  They can approximate what your expended effort based on your weight will be, but they are FAR from accurate.  Under no circumstances should you assume they are correct.

The most common form is localized granuloma annulare, which is characterized by the presence of small, firm red or yellow colored bumps (nodules or papules) that appear arranged in a ring on the skin. In most cases, the sizes of the lesions range from one to five centimeters. The most commonly affected sites include the feet, hands, and fingers. In addition to the localized form, there are four less common forms: generalized or disseminated, linear, perforating, and subcutaneous.

They do have doctor of chiropractic degrees, and are considered chiropractic physicians. \n\nChiropractic has been shown to be effective for low back pain and some other back/neck problems. One of the problems with chiropractic, in my mind, is that many chiropractors claim to treat an entire range of problems, including attention deficit disorder, learning disbilities, diabetes, and many other physical problems that have no known relationship to spinal misalignment. These persons have done a lot of damage to the chiropractic profession, and it has lead to laws in a number of states that regulate chiropractic care more like a consumer good than a medical service.

Second generation anti-histamines do not have a useful effect on colds.\n\nA warm and humid environment and drinking lots of fluids, especially hot liquids, alleviate symptoms somewhat. Common home remedies include camomile or lemon tisanes and chicken soup (which probably work by soothing the irritated respiratory passages with their steam), nebulized medicinal mixtures, hot compresses, mustard plasters, hot toddies, licorice and echinacea. Although there have been scientific studies done on echinacea, its effectiveness has not been demonstrated. Eating very spicy food can help alleviate congestion, although it may also irritate the already-tender throat. Coffee, or its active component, caffeine, has also been shown to improve mood and mental performance during rhinovirus infection. Hot beer is also recommended, and though it probably does little to fight the infection directly, at least it can help to a good night of relaxed sleep.

Or if you want an even harder fix, figure out how many calories are in the item, then figure out how long you would have to walk or run to burn the calories.

Depending on your own mental stability and ability to work thru your own crisis ,along with everybody elses, at the same time is dependent on how you can deal with this stress. The sight of a young child screaming, burning or dead weighs heavy on every officer's mind. The fact you may be envolved with something out of your control sends many officers over the edge. There was a study done and the average age of a police officer is 52. Police officers have the highest suicide rate of any other profession. Living with the fact that as you put the uniform on the thought that you may never make it back home to hug your children or spouse again can be devestating.

Can you tell me about the different types of anemia?", "patient_answer": "Anemia occurs because patients either can't produce enough red blood cells or because red blood cells are lost (bleeding) or destroyed faster than they can be produced. Many different causes of anemia exist. \nIron deficiency anemia. This is the most common type of anemia. It happens when you don't have enough iron in your body. You need iron to make hemoglobin. This can happen when you lose blood from problems like heavy periods, ulcers, colon polyps, or colon cancer. A diet that doesn't have enough iron in it can also cause IDA. Pregnancy can also cause IDA if there's not enough iron for the mother and fetus. \nMegaloblastic (or vitamin deficiency) anemia. This most often happens when your body doesn't get enough folic acid or vitamin B-12. These vitamins help your body keep healthy blood and a healthy nervous system. With this type of anemia, your body makes red blood cells that can't deliver oxygen right. Sometimes, with this disease, your health care provider may not realize you're not getting enough B-12. This usually happens to someone with pernicious anemia, a type of autoimmune disease. B-12 deficiency may also be more common in people with other autoimmune diseases, like Crohn's disease. Not getting enough B-12 can cause numbness in your legs and feet, problems walking, memory loss, and problems seeing. The treatment depends on the cause. But you may need to get B-12 shots or take special B-12 pills. \nUnderlying diseases. Certain diseases can hurt the body's ability to make red blood cells. For example, people with kidney disease, especially those getting dialysis (takes out wastes from your blood if your kidneys can't), are at higher risk for developing anemia. Their kidneys can't create enough hormones to make blood cells, and iron is lost in dialysis. \nInherited blood disease. If you have a blood disease in your family, there is a higher risk that you will also have this disease. One type of inherited blood disease is sickle cell anemia. Instead of having normal red blood cells that move through blood vessels easily, sickle cells are hard and have a curved edge. These cells cannot squeeze through small blood vessels and block the organs from getting blood. Your body destroys sickle red cells quickly, but it can't make new red blood cells fast enough. This causes anemia. Another inherited blood disease is thalassemia. It happens when the body is missing certain genes or when variant (different from normal) genes are passed down from parents that affect how the body makes hemoglobin. \nAplastic anemia. This rare problem happens when your body doesn't make enough red blood cells. Since this affects the white blood cells too, there is a higher risk for infections and bleeding that can't be stopped. This can be caused by many things: cancer treatments (radiation or chemotherapy) exposure to toxic chemicals (like those used in some insecticides, paint, and household cleaners) some drugs (like those that treat rheumatoid arthritis) autoimmune disease(like lupus)viral infection that affects bone marrow or\nbone marrow diseases", "doctor_answer": "Anemia (American English) or anaemia (Commonwealth English), which literally means \"without blood,\" is a deficiency of red blood cells and/or hemoglobin. This results in a reduced ability of blood to transfer oxygen to the tissues, and this causes hypoxia; since all human cells depend on oxygen for survival, varying degrees of anemia can have a wide range of clinical consequences. Hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cells) has to be present to ensure adequate oxygenation of all body tissues and organs.\n\nThe three main classes of anemia include excessive blood loss (acutely such as a hemorrhage or chronically through low-volume loss), excessive red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) or deficient red blood cell production. In menstruating women, dietary iron deficiency is a common cause of deficient red blood cell production.\n\nFollow the link for more information.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"}, {"question": "do sperm have teeth?", "patient_answer": "Yes, sperm have a small circular row of non moving teeth.", "doctor_answer": "It has a tail and a head, so I would guess that it might have huge set of demonic teeth as well .. :-)))\n\nSearch the web or consult your anatomy reference book if you want to know more."}, {"question": "Herbal remedies for depression??", "patient_answer": "I have hears numerous times that saint johns wort works, but honestly you should try and figure out why you are depressed and talk to your Dr. about it.

If you are really craving a hamburger, you probably need protein. If that doughnut looks really good, have some carbohydrates. Your body gets cravings because it needs something from a certain food group. Eating something healthier yet similar can be just a satisfying.", "doctor_answer": "How to Hear What Your Body Needs\nThe SAD diet (standard American diet) really is sad. Most of us consume so much damaged fat, toxic chemicals, sugar, and processed, unhealthy foods that we have lost touch with what our bodies really need. Eating should be an intuitive process, but there are things that can interfere with intuitive eating.\n\n    * Being caught up in research and theories about the \"best\" diet.\n      The value of intuition in eating is lost in our knowledge and science-driven world. Animals instinctively know everything they need to live and they do it. We have the same instinct, but it gets lost in what we are told we should eat by researchers, diet gurus, parents, spouses, talk show hosts, magazines, celebrities and friends.\n\n    * Making weight loss your primary focus.\n      The weight loss industry in the United States is a billion dollar industry. It can harm your metabolism, your wallet, and your confidence. Many chronic dieters develop long-term side effects from being on the wrong diet, such as fatigue and weakness, anxiety, depression, dark circles under the eyes, headaches, joint pain, and poor concentration. They can deprive your body of essential nutrients that it needs to rebuild and can stimulate the release of stress hormones.\n\n    * Chronic stress or illness.\n      Many people under chronic stress lose their taste for food. They view food as fuel or they lose sensitivity to hunger signals. Chronic stress can destabilize blood sugar levels resulting in increased cravings and a constant need to eat. People sometimes become hungry soon after meals and feel lightheaded and faint if they are not able to eat. In addition, chronic stress can trigger irritable bowel, bloating, gas, and pain regardless of what you eat. \nHow to improve your intuitive ability\n\n   1. Start by paying attention to how different foods make you feel.\n\n          * What foods leave satisfied?\n          * What foods give you energy?\n          * What foods make you tired or unable to concentrate?\n          * What foods make you anxious or edgy vs. calm and content?\n          * What foods make you bloated, uncomfortable, or cause pain?\n\n   2. Reduce the amount of junk foods and sugar in your diet.\n\n          * Substitute fruit and then gradually decrease. If you have a sweet tooth, try to gradually substitute the sugar in your diet with fruit. Fruit contains sugar but also has fiber, phytochemicals and antioxidants. Gradually taper the fruit until you are at a level that feels right to you.\n\n          * Use a herbal sweetener. The herbal sweetener Stevia can be used to add sweetness to any dish. Some brands are better than others -- if you try a brand that tastes quite bitter, keep looking.\n\n          * Try spices with a sweet flavor. The spices cinnamon and cloves have a sweet taste, even though they don't contain any sugar. Try making Chai tea, or adding cinnamon to drinks, sauces and desserts for a sweet flavor.\n\n          * Healthier sweeteners. If you do use sugar, try mixing unrefined blackstrap molasses with just enough honey or another natural sweetener to take the bitter edge off the molasses. One tablespoon of blackstrap molasses contains about 179 mg of calcium and 518 mg of potassium. All natural sweeteners such as honey and molasses are still forms of sugar, so don't go overboard on these thinking they are okay."}, {"question": "how to gain self eesteem and self confidence?", "patient_answer": "Age.

This can lead parents to believe that the child is stuttering, or stammering, when in fact it is little more than part of the speech learning process. I have three kids and the youngest is going through the same stage now. She will be two next month. However, approximately 1% of people in the world stutter to some degree or another and it could be that the child in question does have a speech impediment of this kind. If this is the case then no it is not normal but neither is it unheard of. Moreover, the vast majority of children who suffer from genuine as opposed to pseudo stuttering, recover naturally from this condition with only a very small minority carrying the impediment forward into later life. So, if you are the parent of this child, I wouldn't worry yourself too much at this stage but you should monitor the situation and particularly so over the next year.

Using a local antibiotic will probably help, especially if there's a cut. \nDon't pick at or squeeze bumps. That will tend to make things worse. \nMake sure to get your hair very wet before shaving, ideally after taking a bath or shower. If you don't shower first, wet your hair for at least two minutes with warm, soapy water. Wet hair cuts better and easier than dry hair, and is more likely to cut evenly (and not at an angle). \nUse a good shaving cream to reduce friction and irritation. Really work the shaving cream into your scalp for at least two minutes, and save areas that tend to develope bumps for last when you're shaving, so that the shaving cream has longer to soften the hair. \nShave with the grain, not against it. \nDon't go over the same area more than twice. \nDon't stretch out your skin while shaving; let is stay neutral and relaxed. Stretching your skin while you shave increases the chance that the hair will 'snap back' to below skin level. \nReplace your blade regularly. Shaving with a dull blade increases the chances of hair tearing unevenly. \nUse a single-blade razor instead of a double- or triple-blade razor.

I am having a hard time.?", "patient_answer": "Also a diabetic, I found that sugar free things like diet gelatin and using Splenda when cooking and baking helps satisfy my sweet tooth. Zero grams of carb in that diet gelatin, so one can have all they want.  Zero sugar or carbs in whipped cream, when sweetened with Splenda or another artificial sweetner.  You can have all you want and not blow your sugar.\n\nI stay entirely away from white flour 'cause it goes to sugar in the blood stream faster than sugar.  Ditto for rice and pastas, breads.  \n\nThe glycemic index -- a chart that tells how fast any food goes to sugar can be helpful.  I've posted the links below.  That way you can pick and choose the foods you like and know how much you can have of them. As long as you stay with foods that are rated 55 and below, you won't be hungry and won't raise your blood sugar.\n\nIf you learn to read the labels and look for those carbohydrates.  You  may be pleasantly surprised at what you can eat -- and also how much hidden sugar is in other foods one would think were safe.  \n\nOccasionally I have a piece of chocolate.  If I take only a couple of squares, it's 7 grams of sugar.  Not enough to raise blood sugar. If I instead have one of those fruit stirred yogurts, it might contain as much as 46 grams of sugar.  Chocolate?  Yogurt? One could eat the whole candy bar and not get as much sugar as in one of those little \"lite\" diet yogurts filled with sugar.\n\nI have made low carb cheesecake with NO sugar.  Those I served it to didn't know, couldn't tell the difference between mine and Lindy's or any other cheesecake.  Splenda bakes up just like sugar and tastes the same -- no aftertaste.  So experiment with recipes for sweets and substitute something other than sugar.\n\nI have found the best success by making my own diet of foods I like, but watching the carbs.  Especially the refined ones -- like while flour, sugar (watermelon and other sweet fruits, corn, carrots, even beets) , starches (potatoes, rice). I eliminated them.\n\nAnd, most importantly have breakfast in the morning. That will start your  metabolism going.  If you can make it a high protein one, like eggs, meat, milk, plain yogurt, a piece of fruit -- all low carb choices, you will find you won't get hungry and crave sweets and your metabolism will start to burn and stay at a slow, steady burn all morning.\n\nThere are sugar free diet puddings, one can make whipped cream with Splenda or Nutra Sweet, have a piece of fruit (apple), peanut butter on a slice of apple, an occasional piece of candy (just don't eat the whole  bag or box at one sitting), and not feel deprived. Watch your blood sugar, and that will be your guide to what you can eat and how foods affect you.\n\nWith diabetes one's metabolism of sugars plays havoc with our appetite and our energy level.  The secret is keeping one's blood sugar level -- not allowing it to rise fast,which taking in a lot of sugar does to us, and then crashes leaving us hungry and tired.  Proteins digest slowly and release energy slowly,but consistently.  Proteins and fats satisfy our hunger for a longer time.  So adjusting your diet to eliminate the foods that raise blood sugar rapidly like the refined carbohydrates and sweets and replacing them with proteins and fiber, will actually reduce and maybe eliminate your craving for sweets\nGood luck and you can write me if you wish more links and info.  rubysnowdragon@yahoo.com", "doctor_answer": "eat candy but use the \"fun sized\" ones not too many a day though because it will raise your blood sugar and too much sugar free candy will give you the runs so give in once in a while.

Most drugs were used as medicine in the early days. It's when drug abuse occurs that it can be of such a detriment. You can do very real damage to your brain with some of the most widely used drugs available today, alcohol among them. But it is the inhalants that do the damage the fastest. They impart chemical compounds into the bloodstream instead of Oxygen. Thus the brain is robbed of its most vital element. Brain cells then die by the millions. The notion that you become brain damaged by using marijuana or opiates is a bit misleading. The balance of normal brain chemicals is altered, maybe forever, but they are still not killing brain cells. Cocaine is another drug commonly used. It effects the brain chemistry also, but is more damaging to the heart. It kills heart cells on contact in laboratory experiments.

There has been considerable research into possible plant food sources of B12. Fermented soya products, seaweeds and algae have all been proposed as possible sources of B12. However, analysis of fermented soya products, including tempeh, miso, shoyu and tamari, found no significant B12.\n\nSpirulina, an algae available as a dietary supplement in tablet form, and nori, a seaweed, have both appeared to contain significant amounts of B12 after analysis. However, it is thought that this is due to the presence of compounds structurally similar to B12, known as B12 analogues. These cannot be utilised to satisfy dietary needs. Assay methods used to detect B12 are unable to differentiate between B12 and it's analogues, Analysis of possible B12 sources may give false positive results due to the presence of these analogues.\n\nResearchers have suggested that supposed B12 supplements such as spirulina may in fact increase the risk of B12 deficiency disease, as the B12 analogues can compete with B12 and inhibit metabolism.\n\nThe current nutritional consensus is that no plant foods can be relied on as a safe source of vitamin B12.\n\nBacteria present in the large intestine are able to synthesise B12. In the past, it has been thought that the B12 produced by these colonic bacteria could be absorbed and utilised by humans. However, the bacteria produce B12 too far down the intestine for absorption to occur, B12 not being absorbed through the colon lining.\n\nHuman faeces can contain significant B12. A study has shown that a group of Iranian vegans obtained adequate B12 from unwashed vegetables which had been fertilised with human manure. Faecal contamination of vegetables and other plant foods can make a significant contribution to dietary needs, particularly in areas where hygiene standards may be low. This may be responsible for the lack of aneamia due to B12 deficiency in vegan communities in developing countries.\n\nGood sources of vitamin B12 for vegetarians are dairy products or free-range eggs. ½ pint of milk (full fat or semi skimmed) contains 1.2 µg. A slice of vegetarian cheddar cheese (40g) contains 0.5 µg. A boiled egg contains 0.7 µg. Fermentation in the manufacture of yoghurt destroys much of the B12 present. Boiling milk can also destroy much of the B12.\n\nVegans are recommended to ensure their diet includes foods fortified with vitamin B12. A range of B12 fortified foods are available. These include yeast extracts, Vecon vegetable stock, veggieburger mixes, textured vegetable protein, soya milks, vegetable and sunflower margarines, and breakfast cereals."}, {"question": "where do std's/aids come from?", "patient_answer": "yep, animals...\nand caveman lawyers.", "doctor_answer": "Science supports the idea that HIV came from chimpanzees, probably through blood to blood contact.

Once in the body and transformed into glycyrrhizic acid, this chemical inhibits the enzyme (11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) that converts cortisol to cortisone.  Cortisol can bind to the same receptors that aldosterone can (they are both steroid hormones).  So ultimately, the intake of glycyrrhizin leads to the body believing it has a higher level of aldosterone in the body.  This subsequently leads to water and sodium retention, higher blood volume, and therefore, higher blood pressure.\n\nAccording to Hershey's webiste, Twizzlers (a product of Hershey's) is actually made to taste like black licorice, but does not contain either glycyrrhizin or glycyrrhizic acid.  Now, it may contain other ingredients that can still increase blood pressure (sugar in general can increase blood pressure but usually by smaller amounts) but it will not fake out the body that aldosterone levels are high.

That's no good - your brain needs a steady supply of the oxygen the blood carries. So when your body can't get enough blood to your brain because of low blood pressure, it protects you by bringing your brain down to the blood. In other words, the purpose of a faint is to ensure a blood supply to the brain by bringing your head down to the ground, so your heart doesn't have to overcome gravity.", "doctor_answer": "vasovagal syncope, this is the common faint associated with a stress response of the autonomic nervous system which can either suddenly lower the pulse rate, the blood pressure or both together. It is one of the neurally-mediated reflex syncopes.\n\nFainting or syncope is a sudden (and generally momentary) loss of consciousness due to a lack of sufficient blood and oxygen reaching the brain. The first symptoms a person feels before fainting are dizziness and feeling hot. Moments later, the person's vision turns black and he or she drops to the floor (or slumps if seated in a chair).\n\nFactors that influence fainting are taking in too little food and fluids, low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, physical exercise in excess of the energy reserve of the body, and lack of sleep. Even standing up too quickly or being in too hot a room can cause fainting.\n\nFainting involves a temporary reduction of blood (and therefore oxygen) supply to the brain, resulting in a blackout. Many forms of syncope are benign and easy to associate with clear precipitants that can be avoided.

What's less obvious is that it's the most important organ that controls the composition of the body fluids. In addition, it does produce a number of hormones that deal with body function. \n\n\nThe kidney is a filtering organ, so blood is delivered to a very unique apparatus in the kidney called the glomerulus, and there, because of pressure dynamics, a component of the blood is filtered across the membrane, and the first process of creating the urine develops. In this segment of the kidney, in the glomerulus, the composition of that fluid is very similar to blood. The fluid passes through a series of tubules in a structure called the nephron, and there it's modified, heavily modified. A variety of things are reabsorbed that we need, and a variety of toxins are concentrated until the end of the kidney, the end of that nephron segment, drains into something called a papilla, then into the ureter, and then the bladder, and we have what we term \"urine,\" which is a fluid rich in toxic wastes that is excreted. \n\nsuppose you drink a bottle of orange juice.

The assistance ends the life of a person or an animal, in a painless or minimally painful way. Euthanasia is most often performed in a merciful way, in order to end suffering. This article discusses euthanasia in humans; a separate article covers animal euthanasia.\n\nThis topic is often highly-charged—emotionally, politically, and morally. Terminology and laws shift over time and geographically and globally, causing a great deal of confusion.\n\nFirstly there is some debate as to whether euthanasia refers to \"letting die\" or \"allowing to die.\" (See terms: informed consent, decisional capacity, surrogate decision making, Living wills, Do Not Resuscitate) In the United States and the Netherlands, \"letting die\" or \"allowing to die\" refer to areas which the state consider ethically and legally acceptable and permissible. This includes the withholding and withdrawing of medical treatment such as dialysis or feeding tubes or hydration and nutrition. The last two being things which are associated with \"love and caring\" in most cultures. While the concept of holding off on those two things may be counterintuitive, as a body's major organ systems try to shut down, a dying person often feels most comfortable without any fluids or food. To do otherwise is like \"force feeding\" a body that does not \"want\" or need to be fed or hydrated, and doing so may actually cause physical discomfort and suffering.\n\nIn the UK this is usually only accepted when a newly born baby is born with certain physical or mental disorders.\n\nIn most other countries removing or denying treatment would usually be seen as murder. Usually, because in a growing number of law cases over the last 20 years, the jury has sided with the defendant.\n\nNext are several summary statements defining what euthanasia can include,. These are followed by expanded definitions of each. Euthanasia (assisted dying) may employ methods that are either indirect or direct. Indirect methods of euthanasia are defined by a individual him or herself taking the final step inducing death. Direct methods are defined by the involvement of others (clinicians) who take the final step inducing death. Direct euthanasia can either be voluntary, nonvoluntary or involuntary. (See Karl Binding and Alfred Hoche for one of the first uses of the three types of euthanasia.)\n\nIndirect euthanasia involves the indirect involvement of a clinician (e.g. physician, clinical nurse practitioner, pharmacist) as an agent who participates only by providing the means for a patient to induce his/her own death. This could mean writing or filling a prescription for medications in a quantity large enough to cause death when taken by the patient. This kind of assistance is currently legal in the American state of Oregon. It became legal in 1998 as a result of the \"Death with Dignity Act\" which was passed in the state in 1994. In politically and emotionally loaded terms, this is frequently referred to as physician-assisted suicide.\n\nDirect euthanasia involves the direct involvement of a clinician as agent in inducing a patient’s death. (e.g. administering a lethal drug by injection.) Direct euthanasia is not currently legal anywhere in the US, but both direct and indirect euthanasia are legal in Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nVoluntary euthanasia occurs with the fully-informed request of a decisionally-competent adult patient or that of their surrogate (proxy). (Example: Thomas Youk, with ALS was assisted by Jack Kevorkian.)\n\nA large part of the controversy surrounding euthanasia focuses upon the slippery slope argument. The fear is that indirect euthanasia and/or voluntary direct euthanasia will lead to acceptance of the nonvoluntary and involuntary types of euthanasia.\n\nNonvoluntary euthanasia", "doctor_answer": "i dont. i believe life is a gift from God nd only He has the right to take it back. simple as that."}, {"question": "what are the early symptoms of hiv/aids? how does a person knows he/she has pnuemonia?", "patient_answer": "Most of early HIV is without symptoms, but some people can get a flu-like illness with fever, fatigue, sore throat, rash, swollen glands and general weakness.

This treatment is based on evidence that MS is an autoimmune disease that results when there is an abnormal response by the immune system that causes it to attack normal tissues—in this case, the myelin coating that surrounds nerve fibers.\nAlthough these medications do not cure MS, they may reduce the overall number, frequency, and severity of relapses in some people who have the relapsing-remitting MS.

DHT is a highly active form of testosterone, which influences many aspects of manly behavior, from sex drive to aggression. \n\nThe conversion from testosterone to DHT is driven by an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase, which is produced in the prostate, various adrenal glands, and the scalp. Over time, the action of DHT causes the hair follicle to degrade and shortens the anagen phase. Thought the follicle is technically still alive and connected to a good blood supply--it can successfully nurture a transplanted follicle which is immune to the effects of DHT--it will grow smaller and smaller (figure 3). Some follicles will gradually die, but most will simply shrink to the size they were when you were born which produce weaker hairs. With a steadily shorter anagen growing cycle, more hairs are shed, the hairs becoming thinner and thinner until they are too fine to survive daily wear and tear. Balding hair gradually changes from long, thick, coarse, pigmented hair into fine, unpigmented vellus sprouts. \n\nHowever, the sebaceous gland attached to it remains the same size. As the hair shafts become smaller, the gland continues to pump out about the same amount of oil. So as your hair thins, you will notice that your hair becomes flatter and oilier. \n\nBut the hormonal link in balding is complex. Eunuchs, who produce no testosterone, never go bald -- even if carrying a baldness gene. However, if castrated men with a family history of baldness are given testosterone, they lose hair in the classic horseshoe-shaped pattern. \n\nStudies show that while balding men don't have higher than average circulating testosterone levels, they do possess above-average amounts of a powerful testosterone derivative, dihydrotestosterone in the scalp follicles. In male balding, genetically primed follicles convert circulating testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which successively diminishes or miniaturizes follicle size, producing ever weaker hairs. With a steadily shorter anagen growing cycle, more hairs are shed, the hairs becoming thinner and thinner until they are too fine to survive daily wear and tear. Balding hair gradually changes from long, thick, coarse, pigmented hair into fine, depigmented vellus sprouts. \n\nOther physiological factors might cause hair loss. Recently, a group of Japanese researcher reported a correlation between excessive sebum in the scalp and hair loss. Excessive sebum often accompanying thinning hair is attributed to an enlargement of the sebaceous gland. They believed excessive sebum causes an high level of 5-alpha reductase and pore clogging, thus malnutrition of the hair root. \n\nAlthough this condition could be hereditary, they believe diet is a more prominent cause. The researchers note that Japanese hair was thick and healthy, with a small gland and little scalp oil, until the occidental habit of consuming animal fat crept into their diet after World War II. This change has led to a significant height increase in the Japanese population, but it has also resulted in more Japanese men losing hair. To some extent, their observation makes sense since problems with greasy hair have often been noted as much as six months to a year prior to when thinning hair becomes noticeable, but this might be just one of the symptoms, not underlying cause, more research is needed. Most doctors agree that if you have a oily scalp with thinning hair, frequent shampooing is advised. shampooing can reduce surface sebum, which contains high levels of testosterone and DHT that may reenter the skin and affect the hair follicle.", "doctor_answer": "have blood test you could have a over or under active thyroid."}, {"question": "what would cause having blood in the eye?", "patient_answer": "Is it actual blood dripping out of your eye or just redness?

However, studies differ about its efficacy.\n\nIt is commonly added to energy drinks, but it is expensive, so the amount is typically so low it does not produce a noticeable effect, except for the placebo effect from being listed on the label. A study published in the August 21, 2002 issue of Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) suggests that there is no difference between the memory abilities of people taking ginkgo supplements and those taking a placebo.\n\nSide effects\nGinkgo may have some undesirable effects, especially for individuals with blood circulation disorders and those taking anti-coagulants such as aspirin and warfarin, although recent studies have found that ginkgo has little or no effect on the anticoagulant properties or pharmacodynamics of warfarin[1][2]. It should also not be used by people who are taking the anti-depressant drugs known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or by pregnant women.\n\nGinkgo side effects and cautions include increased risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and restlessness. Ginkgo should also not be used by pregnant women or people with a blood clotting disorder.\n\nIf any side effects are experienced the dosage should be lowered immediately. Ginkgo supplements are usually taken in the range of 40-200 mg per day.

The affected individual may have to generate artificial noise that masks the tinnitus sound. A combination of external masking and psychological counseling known as tinnitus retraining therapy is widely practiced. While it does not actually cure the tinnitus, many report that it becomes much less disturbing and easier to ignore.", "doctor_answer": "According to research, gingko is particularly useful for circulatory problems because it works to regulate the tone and elasticity of blood vessels, increasing blood flow to the brain and extremities. Gingko also delivers a boost to the nervous system by stimulating the transmission of extra oxygen and glucose to blood cells. Additionally, gingko performs as a powerful antioxidant by scavenging harmful free radicals and aiding in the maintenance of cells. Gingko biloba can help to relieve depression, headaches, anxiety, tinnitus, and dizziness, while promoting both memory and mental clarity. Controlled studies have shown gingko, which stimulates blood flow to the brain, can improve memory in some people with Alzheimer's disease.

There is NO credible scientific evidence that shows the existence of what constitutes \"bipolar\" as a biological/neurological disorder, brain abnormality or \"chemical imbalance\".\n\n\"For a disease to exist there must be a tangible, objective physical abnormality that can be determined by a test such as, but not limited to, blood or urine test, X-Ray, brain scan or biopsy. All reputable doctors would agree: No physical abnormality, no disease. In psychiatry, no test or brain scan exists to prove that a 'mental disorder' is a physical disease. Disingenuous comparisons between physical and mental illness and medicine are simply part of psychiatry's orchestrated but fraudulent public relations and marketing campaign.\" Fred Baughman, MD., Neurologist & Pediatric Neurologist.\n\n\"Chemical imbalance…it’s a shorthand term really, it’s probably drug industry derived… We don’t have tests because to do it, you’d probably have to take a chunk of brain out of someone - not a good idea.\" Dr. Mark Graff, Chair of the Committee of Public Affairs for the American Psychiatric Association. July, 2005.\n\nSymptoms that psychiatry labels as \"bipolar\" (or it's related disorders), can stem from any number of variable sources. Many people, for example, have overcome \"bipolar\" through megavitamin therapy and effective nutrition. A growing wealth of evidence supports that underlying nutritional deficiencies can cause even the most severe mental disorders, including symptoms labelled as \"schizophrenia\" [See source refs]\n\nBottom line? Psychiatry is a belief-system, a \"faith\", not a science. Despite the huge marketing strategies, the so-called \"research\" and all the propaganda thrown at the world, there is not one iota of scientific evidence that proves that \"schizophrenia\" or ANY mental illness, in fact, exists as an actual --medical disease--.\n\nIf you have been told differently then know this: You have been lied to.\n\nFor more information, please visit:\n\nhttp://groups.msn.com/psychbusters\nDecoding Psychiatric Propaganda\n\nFor information on non-drug / alternative approaches:\n- http://www.alternativementalhealth.com/articles/default.htm#B\n- http://www.pendulum.org/articles/articles_misc_lisaalt.html\n- http://www.truehope.com/_empowerplus/empowerplus.asp\n- http://www.mentalhealthproject.com/content.asp?id_Content=1575", "doctor_answer": "This is a personal decision, but for me the answer to managing my bipolar is meds and therapy. After going on and off for about 2 1/2 years, and dealing with serious consequences, I finally accepted that to have the quality of life I want, I HAVE to take the drugs EVERY DAY for the rest of my life. I've been on them permanently for about 3 1/2 years now. It took a long time to adjust to being so different. At times, I feel like I've lost a bit of my identity, but the positives outweigh that. In a way, I'm MORE myself b/c I can follow through with things that are important to me and I can respect myself more for being true to who I am. When I wasn't managing the bipolar well, I'd do things that weren't \"me\" if I got too up or down. But it did take a long time on the meds to feel like this new me is the real me. I miss some of the highs, b/c I was so creative and productive. But the depressions would always undo any progress I made when up, so overall I didn't move forward with the things that are important to me.

Hope this helps you. :-)", "doctor_answer": "yes there is, and it's called cupping\nand it's the most oldest traditional medicine.\nand the most amazing thing that most latest studies have beeen shown that it releive migarains by 80%>>>>>>\n\nHow does cupping work? What does it treat? \n\nIn a typical cupping session, glass cups are warmed using a cotton ball or other flammable substance, which is soaked in alcohol, let, then placed inside the cup. Burning a substance inside the cup removes all the oxygen, which creates a vacuum.\n\nAs the substance burns, the cup is turned upside-down so that the practitioner can place the cup over a specific area. The vacuum created by the lack of oxygen anchors the cup to the skin and pulls it upward on the inside of the glass as the air inside the jar cools. Drawing up the skin is believed to open up the skin’s pores, which helps to stimulate the flow of blood, balances and realigns the flow of qi, breaks up obstructions, and creates an avenue for toxins to be drawn out of the body.\n\nDepending on the condition being treated, the cups will be left in place from 5 to 10 minutes. Several cups may be placed on a patient’s body at the same time. Some practitioners will also apply small amounts of medicated oils or herbal oils to the skin just before the cupping procedure, which lets them move the cups up and down particular acupoints or meridians after they have been applied.\n\nIn China, cupping is used primarily to treat respiratory conditions such as bronchitis, asthma, and congestion; arthritis; gastrointestinal disorders; and certain types of pain. Some practitioners also use cupping to treat depression and reduce swelling. Fleshy sites on the body, such as the back and stomach (and, to a lesser extent, the arms and legs), are the preferred sites for treatment.\n\nHow many types of cupping are there? \nIn addition to the traditional form of cupping described above, which is known as “dry” cupping, some practitioners also use what is called “wet” or “air” cupping. \n\nIn “air” cupping, instead of using a flame to heat the cup, the cup is applied to the skin, and a suction pump is attached to the rounded end of the jar. The pump is then used to create the vacuum. In “wet” cupping, the skin is punctured before treatment. When the cup is applied and the skin is drawn up, a small amount of blood may flow from the puncture site, which are believed to help remove harmful substances and toxins from the body.\n\nIs cupping safe? Does it hurt? \nWhile cupping is considered relatively safe (especially air cupping, which does not include the risk of fire and heat), it can cause some swelling and bruising on the skin. As the skin under a cup is drawn up, the blood vessels at the surface of the skin expand. This may result in small, circular bruises on the areas where the cups were applied. These bruises are usually painless, however, and disappear within a few days of treatment.\n\nIn addition, there are several instances where cupping should not be performed. Patients with inflamed skin; cases of high fever or convulsions; and patients who bleed easily, are not suitable candidates for cupping. Pregnant women should not have cupping on their stomach or lower back. If the cups are being moved, they should not cross bony areas, such as the ridges of the spine or the shoulder blades.\n\nI would like to learn more about cupping. Where can I find out more information? \nSeveral articles on cupping have been published in peer-reviewed journals and acupuncture websites.

The only nerves that send pain signals to your brain are ones that are specific for pain and are included in the \"sensory\" category.  The vagus nerve has many functions, but it is mostly an autonomic nerve, meaning it is involved in basic human functions (\"fight or flight\" response versus \"rest and digest\").\n\nSince you asked about the \"vagus nerve stimulator\", I assume you are talking about an implanted medical device designed to stimulate the vagus nerve.

What is bipolar disorder? \n\nBipolar disorder is a common, recurrent, severe psychiatric illness that affects an individual's mood, behavior and ability to think clearly. It occurs in 1% to 2% of the population in the United States. A variant, called bipolar II disorder, is probably even more common and occurs in up to 3% of the general population in this country. \n\n2. What are the differences between bipolar I and bipolar II disorders? \n\nBipolar I disorder is characterized by episodes of mania that alternate with periods of depression or periods in which individuals have simultaneously occurring manic and depressive symptoms called mixed states. In contrast, bipolar II disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and milder symptoms of mania, called hypomania. Hypomanic episodes typically do not impair an individual's ability to function to the extent that full-blown manic episodes do additionally; hypomanic episodes are not complicated by psychotic symptoms. \n\n3. What is rapid cycling? \n\nThe term rapid cycling was originally coined by David Dunner, M.D., and Ron Fieve, M.D., in the 1970s when they identified a group of individuals who did not respond well to lithium. These patients typically had four or more episodes of mania or depression in the 12-month interval prior to lithium treatment. This definition has been adopted formally by DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.) and specifically means the occurrence of four or more mood episodes within the preceding year. In severe cases, rapid cycling can occur even within a one-day period. \n\n4. At what age does bipolar disorder appear? \n\nBipolar disorder most commonly presents in the late teens and early 20s. Unfortunately, for most individuals, lifelong treatment may be required to prevent recurrent manic and depressive episodes. Equally unfortunate is evidence that the illness often goes undiagnosed and untreated for many years; the longer the illness progresses without treatment, the greater the impairment in an individual's psychological, educational and vocational development. Additionally, untreated bipolar disorder carries a high risk of suicide. \n\n5. Is bipolar disorder genetic? \n\nBipolar disorder, among all psychiatric illnesses, may have the greatest genetic contribution. For instance, if an individual has a parent with bipolar disorder, the chance that the individual's child will have bipolar disorder is about nine-fold greater than in the general population, with the risk rising from about 1% to about 10%. The inheritability of this illness is estimated to be anywhere from 50% to 80%. On the other hand, if a person with bipolar disorder is thinking about having children, there are still good odds that the child will not have bipolar illness. So the genetic determinants of the illness are complicated. \n\n6. How is bipolar disorder treated? \n\nThe cornerstone of treatment is medications that treat acute manic, depressive or mixed episodes, and which, in the long run, attempt to prevent the recurrence of these episodes. Such medications include lithium, divalproex (Depakote) and, more recently, some of the atypical antipsychotics as well as antidepressants. \n\nPsychotherapy plays an important role in improving the course and outcome of this illness in people. In particular, those with bipolar disorder often have strained relationships with loved ones because of their experiences during manic or depressive episodes; psychotherapy can help repair these torn relationships. In addition, psychotherapy can educate people about the signs and symptoms of their illness, how to pay attention to warning signs and how to nip emerging episodes in the bud. Psychotherapy can also help individuals cope with the stress that can sometimes precipitate manic or depressive episodes. \n\n7.

Although there is no cure, treatment can usually control symptoms and prevent the condition from getting worse.\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, there are steps that you can take at home to help reduce pain and stiffness and allow you to continue daily activities. These steps include:\n\nEducating yourself. Learn all you can about your condition and know what complications to watch for. This will help you control your symptoms and stay more active.\n \nReducing pain by taking pain relievers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or using heat to decrease your pain and stiffness. Warm showers or baths or sleeping under a warm electric blanket may reduce stiffness. \n\nExercising regularly. This reduces pain and stiffness and helps maintain fitness and mobility of the spine, chest, and joints. Your doctor may recommend physical therapy to get you started on an exercise program. \n\nDeep breathing exercises can improve or maintain lung capacity.\n\nSwimming as part of your exercise program helps to maintain chest expansion and movement of the spine without jarring the spine. Breast stroke is especially good for chest expansion. \n\nYou should avoid contact sports, since joint fusion may make your spine more likely to fracture as the disease progresses, but your doctor may approve of other activities such as golf and tennis. Check with your doctor before you add any new activity.\n \nMaintaining proper posture and chest expansion. Good posture is important because it can help prevent abnormal bending of the spine. \n\nMaintaining chest expansion will help prevent problems such as lung infection (pneumonia). It's a good idea to lie on your stomach a few times each day to keep your spine and hips extended. \n\nFor sleeping, choose a firm mattress and a small pillow that supports your neck. \n\nAvoiding smoking, to prevent serious breathing difficulties and lung scarring. Lung damage from smoking, combined with decreased chest expansion and the lung infections that sometimes go with ankylosing spondylitis, can seriously limit your ability to breathe freely. \n\n\nHaving regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist, to check for inflammation of the colored part of the eye (iritis).\n \nJoining a support group.

Its important to understand that different individuals react differently to the same medication.  Somtimes the sexual side effects from an antidepressant are a good trade off with the overall benefits of the drug, sometimes not.  \"Stop getting off\" is a choice :-).  If your libido is comparatively low, you might not feel like indulging in sexual activity a lot, unless stimulated.  That again is a subjective thing.  Some men are prescribed antidepressants for premature ejaculation because it helps them to slow down and retain an erection for a longer time.\n\nAs far as weight is concerned, once you are \"off your butt\" you can do a lot to maintain that.  Dont expect the antidepressant to be a wonder drug but something that helps you \"for a while.\"\n\nThere are different kind of antidepressants -\n\n1.  Tricyclic antidepressants (Elavil, Endep, Anafranil, Norpramin, Pertofrane, Adapin, Sinequan, Tofranil, Aventyl, Vivactil, Surmontil)\n\n2.  Tetracyclic antidepressants (Asendin, Ludiomil).\n\n3.  SSRI antidepressants: Celexa, Prozac, Luvox, Paxil, Zoloft.\n\n4.  MAO inhibitors (Marplan, Nardil, Eldepryl, Parnate)\n\n5.  Serotonin antagonists (Serzone, Desyrel)\n\n6.  Others (Wellbutrin, Effexor, Remeron)\n\nMood stabilizers\n\nTegretol, Neurontin, Lamictal, Eskalith, Depakene, Depakote.\n\nThe most commonly used antidepressants are SSRIs with Prozac being considered almost a synonym for an antidepressant.\n\nWeight gain or loss and decreased or increased libido are not the only side effects of antidepressants.  There are other potentially dangerous side effects like muscular spasms and lethal interactions with other drugs that it makes it imperative to seek psychiatric consultation before you start on them.\n\nThe best treatment is a combination of cognitive therapy with an antidepressant.   Feeling Good by David D. Burns, M.D. is the Bible for depressed inviduals and psychiatrists themselves prescribe it to patients.  So go grab it first.

They will be your ... \"Bible\", from now on !\n* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\n• Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\n• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\n• Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have \"low fat\" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\n• About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\n\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\n\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle \"burn\". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\n\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\n\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\n\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \n\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\n\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\n\ngood luck", "doctor_answer": "My Mom had an operation done that removed the Baby fat, however she does not recommend such an operation at all."}, {"question": "When I get an erection my penis curves down, why does it do this and how to fix it.?", "patient_answer": "Sorry, I think there is nothing to do.

Early symptoms of type 1 diabetes are often polyuria (frequent urination) and polydipsia (increased thirst, and consequent increased fluid intake). There may also be weight loss (despite normal or increased eating), increased appetite, and irreducible fatigue. These symptoms may also manifest in Type 2 diabetes in patients who present with frank poorly controlled diabetes.\n\nThirst develops because of osmotic effects — sufficiently high glucose (above the 'renal threshold') in the blood is excreted by the kidneys but this requires water to carry it and causes increased fluid loss, which must be replaced. The lost blood volume will be replaced from water held inside body cells, causing dehydration.\n\nAnother common presenting symptom is altered vision. Prolonged high blood glucose causes changes in the shape of the lens in the eye, leading to blurred vision and, perhaps, a visit to an optometrist. All unexplained quick changes in eyesight should force a fasting blood glucose test. These are now quick (less than 5 minutes total), inexpensive (materials less than USD $1), and can be safely performed by almost anyone with trivial training.\n\nEspecially dangerous symptoms in diabetics include the smell of acetone on the patient's breath (a sign of ketoacidosis), Kussmaul breathing (a rapid, deep breathing), and any altered state of consciousness or arousal (hostility and mania are both possible, as is confusion and lethargy). The most dangerous form of altered consciousness is the so-called \"diabetic coma\" which produces unconsciousness. Early symptoms of impending diabetic coma include polyuria, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, with lethargy and somnolence a later development, progressing to unconsciousness and death if untreated.", "doctor_answer": "Some diabetes symptoms include:\n\n\n    * Frequent urination\n    * Excessive thirst\n    * Extreme hunger\n    * Unusual weight loss\n    * Increased fatigue\n    * Irritability\n    * Blurry vision"}, {"question": "And STD....i belled to be called H.P.V. ? ?", "patient_answer": "Since lilemt told you the definition, I'll tell you what its like to have it personaly.

As for oral sex no its not transmittable. kissing your safe too. Do know that people will still want you and still want to be with you even though you have a uncurable std. Just be sure to tell your partner before you have sex or even protected sex, because its still transmittable with a condom.  The best thing you can do for your friend is don't treat her like she has an illness. Hug her up, hell even drink after her just to let her know she's not discussting.

Whether you are a nurse that is constantly on your feet, or a secretary that spends hours behind a desk and performs data entry, poor posture will inevitably lead to musculo-skeletal injury and pain. It therefore behooves all of us to use good posture in our daily activities, such as sitting, standing and walking. \n\nIdeal posture is basically that body configuration that requires the minimal amount of energy to keep us seated or upright. Once you deviate from that position, certain muscle groups get fatigued and problems will result. For instance, if you are a secretary, and you do not use a headset, and you consistently tilt your head to the side to approximate the head to the phone, you are going to have neck pain. A chronically tilted head requires your lateral flexors of the neck to work overtime, resulting in sprains/strains. \n\nWhile standing, our base support starts with our feet. Our spine by design has several curvatures to maximize our ability to balance, and at the same time minimizes the amount of energy required to maintain this posture. High heels, as worn by many women, of course forcibly deviates your body’s curvatures from ideal, leading to back pain, knee pain, and foot pain. An innovative new product on the market, called Z-Coil shoes, may actually help improve your posture. These shoes were actually designed to prevent foot, back, and leg pain. These shoes have a built-in orthotic, a rocker-bottom forefoot neoprene sole, and a metal coil under the heel for maximum shock absorption. Advantages of these shoes include impact reduction, stimulation of the balancing system due to the elasticity of the coil. \n\nThe loss of the ability to coordinate our muscles for balancing is one of the main reasons seniors fall and sustain hip fractures. I believe, Z-Coils may actually help in maintaining our balancing system, which of course involves the brain. This would be due to the fact that the coil has a give on impact, which forces you to work on your balance. Better balance, less impact on the back from standing, may help your posture, especially if there already is pain and inflammation in the affected area of the spine. \n\nSince 1994, Doctor Erwin Linzner has managed a chiropractic practice in Rohnert Park, California.

Does it give any harmful side effects?) and efficacy (Does it actually make you feel better?).  Your doctor will be the best person to talk to in order to decide on which medication is best for you.  \n\nThere are a number of medications that are available for COPD.  There are bronchodilators such as Ventolin (salbutamol), Serevent(salmeterol), and the newest Spiriva(tiotropium bromide)- these generally are used to relieve shortness of breath and open up the airways to the lungs.  There are long-acting and short-acting bronchodilators.  This is the largest class of drugs used for COPD.\n\nThere are oral (prednisone) or inhaled corticosteroids, including Flovent (fluticasone), Pulmicort (budesonide).  These are more for treating inflammation in the lungs, and only help a small portion of COPD sufferers.  This class of drugs was first developed to treat asthma patients, which is a different pathology.  New research, however, shows that there are more common elements to asthma and COPD than pulmonologists had once believed.  As such, they are seeing that some COPDers benefit from asthma medications.\n\nThere have been studies that link COPD to an inflammatory response via the phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) pathway and new drugs are currently being tested that could make it to market.  Ariflo (cilomilast) is the drug that is the closest to being approved, with other drug candidates coming from Bayer and Byk Gulden also being developed.  If your COPD is relatively advanced, and your quality of life has not improved greatly, PDE-4 medications may offer an alternative.  However, one compound from Merck was discontinued due to safety concerns because the drug caused one case of colitis.  \n\nMuch like all drugs, one must seriously weigh the benefits and risks.

This theory helps explain why we yawn in groups. Larger groups produce more carbon dioxide, which means our bodies would act to draw in more oxygen and get rid of the excess carbon dioxide. However, if our bodies make us yawn to drawn in needed oxygen, wouldn't we yawn during exercise? Robert Provine, a psychologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and a leading expert on yawning, has tested this theory. Giving people additional oxygen didn't decrease yawning and decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide in a subject's environment also didn't prevent yawning. \nThe Evolution Theory -- Some think that yawning is something that began with our ancestors, who used yawning to show their teeth and intimidate others. An offshoot of this theory is the idea that yawning developed from early man as a signal for us to change activities. \nThe Boredom Theory -- In the dictionary, yawning is said to be caused by boredom, fatigue or drowsiness. Although we do tend to yawn when bored or tired, this theory doesn't explain why Olympic athletes yawn right before they compete in their event. It's doubtful that they are bored with the world watching them", "doctor_answer": "\"While the dictionary tells us that yawning is caused by being fatigued, drowsy or bored, scientists are discovering that there is more to yawning than what most people think.

A common cause is leaning or lying awkwardly on a limb, which either presses against the nerves or reduces the blood supply to the local area. Changing position quickly restores normal feeling.

You may have no intention of becoming a father just yet, but it is always best to prepare for the future. A diminishing sperm count is not reversible! Dr Simon Fishel of the Worldwide Infertility Network - which has both European and US bases - suggests six ways to maintain sufficient amounts of healthy sperm:\n\nAvoid hot baths - the testicles need to be cooler than the rest of the body. \nWear loose underwear - boxers rather than Y-fronts. \nStop smoking and refrain from all recreational drugs. \nCut down on alcohol. \nIncrease your intake of zinc, which can be found in grains, beans, milk and meat. \nIncrease your intake of selenium. \nFor men with low sperm counts, but who are still fertile, there is no need to run to the nearest IVF clinic just yet. It is undoubtedly more pleasant to conceive a child in bed than in a clinic and clinics suggest that men try to increase their production of healthy sperm first, before undergoing expensive fertility treatments.\n\nTo increase your sperm count:\n\nYour diet should include the anti-oxidant vitamins C and E, which can be found in citrus fruits.

The main problem is that both obese and drug addicts have habits that causing them to either eat or do drug. Both of them also have physical addiction that needed to be treated accordingly. Only after facing those two major factors it will be the time for diets. <br />\nAnother major issue is that the society actually unknowingly supports obesity; let me give you an example- today in the US, an obese person can claim disability and get welfare. By that, the government actually encourages obesity. Why would someone even try to get better? <br />\nAuthorities should condition those allowances: if you lose weight over a specified period you will continue getting it. If you did not lose weight you lose the allowance.<br />\nWe should always keep in mind that obesity costs a lot more then just the allowance that the obese person gets. There is the health costs, taxes lost and so on.<br />\nI say- do what you can to leave healthy life, and don’t give up", "doctor_answer": "A key cause of obesity is the low nutritional content of industrially processed foods--because the body doesn't receive enough nutrition it continues to crave more food. Few diets focus, as they should, on non-processed nutritionally dense food--instead, in many cases, the patient is actually eating even more processed food products, exacerbating rather than solving the problem.<br />\n<br />\nBottom line, as we hear so often, obesity is largely caused by bad habits in terms of diet and exercise, and many people aren't willing to permanently let go of those habits, so it's hardly surprising when they fail to achieve the results they want."}, {"question": "how do i calculate how much calorie intake i need daily?", "patient_answer": "you have to consider what your body mass is ?", "doctor_answer": "There are a few formula we use when we work in a clinical setting.

Assessing patients, you could be the first health care professional to recognize that a patient has signs and symptoms of SARS. In SARS with moderate respiratory illness, you'll note a fever higher than 100.4° F (38° C) and one or more of the following symptoms: cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or hypoxia.\n\nIn SARS with severe symptoms of respiratory illness, you'll find a temperature greater than 100.4° F, one or more of the previously mentioned clinical signs and symptoms, and a chest X-ray that reveals pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The chest X-ray may be normal at first, but changes may appear 3 or 4 days following infection, particularly in the lung bases.\n\nIf your patient has some or all of these suspicious signs and symptoms, take a detailed medical and travel history to determine his risk of exposure to SARS. Suspect SARS if he reports either of the following circumstances within 10 days of symptom onset:\n\n* travel to an area with a known or suspected SARS outbreak. Just passing through the airport counts. The CDC Web site (httpV/www.cdc.gov/ ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm) can tell you which areas qualify\n\n* close contact with someone known or suspected to have SARS.\n\nIf you work in a primary care provider's office and suspect that a patient has SARS, contact the hospital before sending the patient there, so that hospital staff can make arrangements to prevent transmission of SARS to others in the facility.\n\nIf you suspect SARS...\n\nImmediately have your patient put on a surgical face mask and make arrangements to isolate him, ideally in a negative-pressure isolation room. Protect yourself by donning an N95 disposable paniculate respirator or surgical mask, gown, gloves, and eye protection and observing meticulous hand hygiene.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that any health care provider caring for a patient with a suspected case of SARS notify local public health authorities as soon as possible, so the patient's close contacts can be tracked and monitored. (Health Canada recommends similar management strategies.)\n\nDiagnostic tests for SARS\n\nThe SARS virus may be detected in a patient's nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal secretions, blood serum, or stool. The CDC, as well as many state public health labs, can process specimens. Three types of diagnostic tests are used for SARS:\n\n* a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test to detect RNA of SARS-CoV Two tests on two different specimens must be positive to confirm SARS.\n\n* serum tests to detect antibodies IgM (gamma M immunoglobulin) and IgG (gamma G immunoglobulin). The test result is negative if no SARS-CoV antibodies are found in serum obtained more than 28 days after symptom onset.\n\n* a viral cell culture test to detect SARS-CoV\n\nIn September 2003, a 15-minute, palm-sized SARS detection kit was developed by Genelabs Diagnostics and the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, both of Singapore. This test generates accurate results with just a drop of serum, plasma, or blood and is designed to be used by people without special training in locations (such as airports) where lab facilities aren't available. The test is expected to be available to hospitals soon.\n\nOther helpful tests\n\nAlong with baseline vital signs, chest X-rays, and the diagnostic tests listed above, tests that may help confirm or rule out SARS include a complete blood cell count, arterial blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry values, clotting profile, respiratory viral panel for influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial viruses, metabolic profile, examination of bronchoalveolar lavage from the lower respiratory tract, C-reactive protein test, and Legionella and pneumococcal urinary antigen testing.\n\nPatients with SARS may have lymphopenia and mild thrombocytopenia.

It's a proven fact that when someone who is mentally \"in pain\" says they are in pain, the brain is responding in the same way it would if there were physical pain being inflicted on the person.

Drink more water than you usually do. Eight glasses a day is standard when you're healthy, so try to drink more than that.\n \n3.  Substitute herbal tea or juice for water to make your liquid intake goals.\n \n4.  Let your appetite dictate how much you eat. If you're not hungry at all, try eating something that's easy to digest, like a banana. Sugar may have a negative impact on your immune system, so limit sweets.\n \n5. Eat chicken soup if it makes you feel better. It can't rid your body of the virus, but it's easy to digest and may soothe your throat.\n \n6. Drink an immune-boosting tea of echinacea or goldenseal. You can also take capsules or a tincture.\n \n7.

The person's mood usually swings from overly \"high\" and irritable to sad and hopeless, and then back again, with periods of normal mood in between. \n\nBipolar disorder typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood and continues throughout life. It is often not recognized as an illness, and people who have it may suffer needlessly for years or even decades. \n\nEffective treatments are available that greatly alleviate the suffering caused by bipolar disorder and can usually prevent its devastating complications. These include marital break-ups, job loss, alcohol and drug abuse, and suicide. \n\nHere are some facts about bipolar disorder. \n\n  \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAWARENESS\nManic-depressive illness has a devastating impact on many people.\nAt least 2 million Americans suffer from manic-depressive illness. For those afflicted with the illness, it is extremely distressing and disruptive.\n\nLike other serious illnesses, bipolar disorder is also hard on spouses, family members, friends, and employers.\n\nFamily members of people with bipolar disorder often have to cope with serious behavioral problems (such as wild spending sprees) and the lasting consequences of these behaviors.\n\nBipolar disorder tends to run in families and is believed to be inherited in many cases. Despite vigorous research efforts, a specific genetic defect associated with the disease has not yet been detected.\n\nBipolar illness has been diagnosed in children under age 12, although it is not common in this age bracket. It can be confused with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, so careful diagnosis is necessary. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRECOGNITION\nBipolar disorder involves cycles of mania and depression.\nSigns and symptoms of mania include discrete periods of: \n\nIncreased energy, activity, restlessness, racing thoughts, and rapid talking\n\nExcessive \"high\" or euphoric feelings\n\nExtreme irritability and distractibility\n\nDecreased need for sleep\n\nUnrealistic beliefs in one's abilities and powers\n\nUncharacteristically poor judgment\n\nA sustained period of behavior that is different from usual\n\nIncreased sexual drive\n\nAbuse of drugs, particularly cocaine, alcohol, and sleeping medications\n\nProvocative, intrusive, or aggressive behavior\n\nDenial that anything is wrong \nSigns and symptoms of depression include discrete periods of: \n\nPersistent sad, anxious, or empty mood\n\nFeelings of hopelessness or pessimism\n\nFeelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness\n\nLoss of interest or pleasure in ordinary activities, including sex\n\nDecreased energy, a feeling of fatigue or of being \"slowed down\"\n\nDifficulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions\n\nRestlessness or irritability\n\nSleep disturbances\n\nLoss of appetite and weight, or weight gain\n\nChronic pain or other persistent bodily symptoms that are not caused by physical disease\n\nThoughts of death or suicide; suicide attempts \nIt may be helpful to think of the various mood states in manic-depressive illness as a spectrum or continuous range. At one end is severe depression, which shades into moderate depression; then come mild and brief mood disturbances that many people call \"the blues,\" then normal mood, then hypomania (a mild form of mania), and then mania. \n\nSome people with untreated bipolar disorder have repeated depressions and only an occasional episode of hypomania (bipolar II). In the other extreme, mania may be the main problem and depression may occur only infrequently.

Blessings!\n\nSeasonal Defense (90) \nPowerful Immune Support\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDescription: Seasonal changes can be quite stressful to the body. That's why it is important to support your immune system. Seasonal Defense combines andrographis with other immune-supporting herbs, including Fructus aurantia (six percent synephrine extract), thyme, oregano and eleuthero root for complete immune support.\n\nAndrographis has been used for centuries by many cultures. It is used widely in Ayurvedic medicine and is considered a “cold property” herb in traditional Chinese approaches; it is used to rid the body of “heat” and dispel toxins. Andrographis supports the immune system by promoting both specific and non-specific immune-response functions as well as maintaining the muscles in the respiratory system. Other studies show that synephrine may be able to help maintain the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract and that thyme and eleuthero root both have beneficial properties.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBenefits: \n•  Helps the body defend against seasonal changes. \n•  Contains andrographis to help boost the immune system. \n•  Helps support mucous membrane health. \n \nPurchase Information \nSEASONAL DEFENSE (90)  \nStock No.:806-6 \nQV: 12.40 \nMember Cost: $12.40\nNon-Member Cost: $18.60  \n\nhttp://www.mynsp.com/lifemoreabundantlyinc/products/guide.aspx?stockNum=8066"}, {"question": "Anyone have surgury on anything?

They have programs (even some on the computer) that can help in the strengthening of these muscles.  But you really need to discuss this with your eye doctor.", "doctor_answer": "Ocular myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disease of the neuromuscular junction resulting in hallmark variability in muscle weakness and fatigability. MG is an autoimmune disease where anomalous antibodies are produced against the naturally occurring acetylcholine (ACh) receptors in voluntary muscles. MG may be limited to the muscles of the eye (ocular MG), leading to abrupt onset of weakness/fatigability of the eyelids or eye movement. MG may also involve other muscle groups (generalized MG). This article will focus on ocular MG, as the generalized form is discussed elsewhere (Myasthenia gravis).\n\n\nAlthough these blocking antibodies may be confined to one of the larger muscles responsible for moving the face or appendages or for breathing, about 90% of MG patients eventually have eye involvement. The most common symptoms are double vision (diplopia) and eyelid drooping (ptosis), whereas the pupil is always spared. Diplopia occurs when MG affects a single extraocular muscle in one eye, limiting eye movement and leading to double vision when the eye is turned toward the affected muscle. Ptosis occurs when the muscle responsible for eyelid elevation is affected on one or both sides, leading to eyelid drooping. Although these symptoms may not be readily apparent in well-rested patients, weakness can usually be induced with exercise of the commonly affected muscles (ie. by having the patient look upward for about 60 seconds).\n\nIn 75% of MG cases, the initial manifestation is in the eye. Within 2 years, 80% of patients with ocular onset of MG will progress to involve other muscle groups, thereby developing generalized MG. The other 20% of patients continue to have purely ocular MG. If MG is confined to the ocular muscles for more than 3 years, there is a 94% likelihood that the symptoms will not worsen or generalize.\n\nAside from asymmetric ptosis (worse with fatigue, sustained upgaze and at the end of the day) and variable limitation of extraocular muscles/diplopia, other clinical signs of ocular MG include gaze-evoked nystagmus (rapid, involuntary, oscillatory motion of the eyeball) and Cogan’s lid twitch (upper lid twitch present when patient looks straight ahead after looking down for 10-15 seconds).\n\nMG is characteristically variable in course, with the frequency of diplopia and ptosis affected by environmental, emotional and physical factors such as bright sunlight, stress, viral illness, menstruation, pregnancy, etc. Spontaneous remission can occur in any patient and remain for years. In a study of the natural history of generalized MG among 168 patients (with an average follow-up of 12 years), 14% experienced complete remission."}, {"question": "how long does it take for wisdom teeth to come in?", "patient_answer": "Sometimes forever!", "doctor_answer": "It is different for everybody.

If these two images are very different sizes, your brain can't put them together into one image and you see double.  If both of your eyes can be corrected to 20/20 vision, I would ask your doctor (or another doctor, if you'd like a second opinion) if LASIK is an option for you.  This could possibly bring your very near-sighted eye close enough to the other eye so that your brain would be able to make a single image.", "doctor_answer": "I've been using spec's with different glasses fo decades.

Personal Heatlh Record is the basic unit of an EHR - that is, it only describes information about one person.  A PHR is one instance of a EHR.  EHR could be used to describe a collection of many PHRs in a system at a particular hospital, for example.  One EHR though describes the entire health of a patient, which can include old information (past surgeries, for example), current information (what medications are being prescribed), or future information (what is the future medical treatment plan for this patient).\n\nElectronic Medical Records (EMRs) are similar to EHRs but are more specific to medical information.  Health information is broader and may include information on the patient's diet, their consent in a clinical trial, and other non-medically related details of their health.\n\nThe official standards for these terms and definitions can be found below.  These are put out by the HIMSS (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society) and approved by the Health Level 7 committee - a major player in electronic medical record standards.", "doctor_answer": "This is a complex issue because there are different ways of looking at the attributes of \"records\" and many different stakeholders in healthcare that view the \"person\" from different perspectives. Terminology is key, and there is still no ccnsensus on terms. Patient-centric health records could be EMR, EHR, PHR, CPR or many other things. There is a \"view\" that keys off the name of the person themselves, which is the most common way for interacting with any type of electronic records in healthcare. However, the creation of data, communication around it, organization, and rules may well be \"clinician or organization-centric\".  A \"Person-centered\" record would revolve primarily around that person regardless of whether they went to hospitals, pharmacies, alternative care providers, clinics, or did self care. The rules around access, what types of information are included, how information is validated, audits of activity, and how communication occurs would emanate from the preferences of the \"person\" not the constraints of a specific organization, practice, or integrated network.\n\nOne way to summarize is that an EMR is a set of records and processes for whom the primary stakeholder is the clinician practice (even if in the context of a hospital). An Inbox, a document repository, an ordering system, and disease registry/alerts have certain features that are more important when in the context of an EMR. Documenting care is critical to being reimbursed, if you are a clinician. It is more critical for safety and clarity if you are a patient, because of the focus on what others might need to do with the information. Of course in the real world this is a far more \"grey zone\" and there is more overlap than not.  \n\nA PHR could be viewed as a set of records and processes for whom the primary stakeholder is the patient and family caregiver.  There might be times when it is more helpful for a clinician to be looking at, updating or interacting with a PHR than with their own EMR! (it is one thing to send a message out from an EMR and hope it gets to the patient, it is another thing to post a message about a patient directly into their \"personal space\" where there might be a clearer understanding about how that patient is intending to receive and interact with information). \n\nAs the world of online personal information management and identity management mature, this focus on the primary \"stakeholder\" might become a more important one. The American Health Information Management Association has done some very good work around the PHR. They represent a very large number of medical records professionals, and have a broad industry perspective on the PHR.  Medicare, as well as other large payers, are actively exploring their roles relative to the patient-centric PHR as well. Active ongoing public diaogues and blogs in which both clinicians, consumers, care managers, and other stakeholders participate, might be a very good way to gradually develop a more universal set of definitions around the PHR itself."}, {"question": "Can cancer be considered an std?", "patient_answer": "no.", "doctor_answer": "If you're talking about cervical cancer...it is caused mostly by the HPV or human papilloma virus which is sexually transmitted."}, {"question": "He has a reoccuring single blister on his penis that comes once a yr from stress.

It is also referred to as osteoarthritis, arthrosis and spinal arthritis. The joint surface may become eroded and the gristle or cartilage that lines the joint is no longer smooth but pitted. This results in pain and inflammation occurring with movement. In addition to this there is a process of thickening in the ligaments around the joints as well, a gradual deformity of the joint itself rather like the end of a stick that has been hit with a mallet. The result is a splaying out of the joint surface and this edge of bone (osteophytes) causes a characteristic appearance with apparent swelling and enlargement of the joint itself. In addition to these changes, the joint may become inflamed with redness heat and swelling with accompanying pain.

It usually begins between two and six months of age with very dry and sensitive skin that will then become red and extremely itchy. It often starts on the forehead, cheeks and scalp and spreads to the trunk, creases of the elbows, knees, and wrists. With scratching the rash may become raw, crusted and weepy.\n\nIt is not yet known what causes it, but it does seem to run in families that have a history of asthma, allergies or atopic dermatitis. It is a chronic disease, but only about a third of children with infantile atopic dermatitis will continue to have problems with it as they get older.\n\nThere is no cure for this common condition. The main treatments are aimed at controlling and preventing inflammation and itching and include avoiding triggers, frequent bathing and hydrating of the skin, liberal use of moisturizers and lubricants, and the use of steroid creams for flare ups.\n\nNew Medications Protopic: or tacrolimus, an immunomodulator ointment that in the 0.03% strength is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) when other therapies have not been effective. Elidel: or pimercrolimus, is another non-steroidal cream that in the 1% strength is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (eczema) in children over 2 years of age.\n\nLubricants\nTo help with dryness, these creams, such as Eucerin, Nivea, or Lubriderm, should be used every day, even when the eczema isn't flaring-up!\n\nApply right after baths within 3 minutes (and after the steroid creams) to help trap in moisture and throughout the day as needed. For severely dry skin, try using an ointment, such as Aquaphor.\n\nAlternative lubricants that some parents find useful include Hydrolatum and Vanicream.\n\nMany experts recommend avoiding moisturizing lotions, as they often don't work as well as a cream or ointment.\n\nSteroid Creams\nThese are the main treatments for atopic dermatitis when it flares up, and should be applied right after baths (and before a lubricant) and again during the day as directed. When the rash improves, cut back on how often you are using it and then stop until the rash flares up again.\n\nCommon steroid creams include Cutivate, Westcort and Artistocort, and Elocon.\n\nAvoid using prescription steroid creams on the face or in the diaper area, unless specifically instructed to do so. An over the counter 1% Hydrocortisone cream is safer in these areas.\n\nFor severe cases of eczema, a steroid ointment may be more effective than a cream.\n\nIf your child's eczema improves when he is on a steroid and then quickly flares up again when you stop, it may help to use a 'step down' strategy where you taper the use of the steroid and use it less often, for example every other day and then 2-3 times a week, before finally stopping it. Or use a less potent steroid, like over the counter hydrocortizone after using a prescription strength steroid like Cutivate or Elocon.\n\nYou might also ask your doctor about one of the newer non-steroidal medications, like Protopic or Elidel.\n\nBathing and Eczema\nBathing and eczema is a controversial topic, but many people think the practice of limiting baths is old school or old fashioned. Many experts now recommend a daily bath for kids with eczema.\n\nA daily bath for at least 15-20 minutes helps to moisturize the skin and make it less itchy. Be sure to use a mild, nondrying soap, such as Dove, Neutrogena, Tone, Caress, Dial, Basis, or Purpose, avoid vigorous scrubbing, use a soft towel to pat the skin dry and immediately (within 3 minutes) apply a lubricating cream afterwards.\n\nIf your child's skin is not tolerating a daily bath, limit baths to every other day or try using a soap substitute, such as Cetaphil.

It can cause various symptoms, but the main ones relate to the skin, kidney (lupus nephritis), joints, blood and immune system.\n\nCommon initial and chronic complaints are fever, malaise, joint pains, myalgias and fatigue. Because they are so often seen with other diseases, these signs and symptoms are not part of the diagnostic criteria for SLE. When occurring in conjunction with other signs and symptoms, however, they are considered suggestive.\n\nSLE is a chronic disease with no cure. There are, however, some medications, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants which can control the disease and prevent flares. Flares are typically treated with steroids, with DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheutmatic drugs) to suppress the disease process, reduce steroid needs and prevent flares. DMARDs commonly in use are the antimalarials (e.g. hydroxychloroquine) and azathioprine. Cyclophosphamide is used for severe nephritis or other organ-damaging complications.\n\nPatients who require steroids frequently may develop obesity, diabetes and osteoporosis. Hence, steroids are avoided where possible.\n\nMeasures such as avoiding sunlight (to prevent problems due to photosensitivity) may also have some effect.\n\nOther immunosuppressants and autologous stem cell transplants are under investigation.\n\nA good website is the \"Alliance for Lupus Research\" at http://www.lupusresearch.org/", "doctor_answer": "Lupus: The lupus widespread eritematoso, or simply lupus, is an illness of the system of immunity that is sometimes lethal, and it affects to a considerable quantity of American, between 500.000 and 1.000.000.

How you ask. . . I saw a sign that said, \"Free Message\", and I went in.  There I got to try a message bed that has acupuncture and infa-red heating (plus more).  After several tryies on this bed, I noticed that I would not smoke for 3 hours after I got a message.  I turned to one of my \"Quit Smoking\" guides, and it reccommended messages as a tool to help reduce cravings.\n\nI took it another step and tryied \"Hypnosis\".  I bet you've seen the adds. . . \"Quit Smoking\" through Hypnosis.

I go daily for my free message and while I get my message, I listen to my \"Stop Smoking Hypnosis\" Tape plus a extra Hypnosis tape (Deppression, Anger Management, Weight Loss, Memory Improvement, Relationship enhancement for Women, ect).  You probably don't realize that taking away the chemicals in cigaretts can make your memory decrease, or you get depressed. . . but this is part of the big factor of giving up the cig's. . . This is part of the reason why you can't give them up is because there are too many other emotions that stop you. . . So this is why I listen to the other tapes as well. \n\nMy hypnotic instructor told me to listen to the tapes 2-3 times a day for 21 days (each tape is 20 minutes long).  So I spend 40 minutes to 1.5 hours a day practicing to quit smoking.  Now, when I smoked, I had 15 cigs a day.  Each cig took 10 minutes to smoke.  So I spent 2.5 hours a day smoking.  So I've actually gained time.\n\n5 days after I quit, I found a pack of cig's with 1 cig (my upside down lucky cig), and I was tempted for 1/100 of a second, and then smashed it and said\" I am a non-smoker\".  \n\nSo basically, my daily message's and hypnosis tapes are working better than any past attempt I've ever tried!

It is thought that appendicitisbegins when the opening from the appendix into the cecum becomes blocked. Theblockage may be due to a build-up of thick mucus within the appendix or to stool that enters the appendix from the cecum. The mucus or stool hardens, becomes rock-like, and blocks the opening. This rock is called a fecalith (literally, arock of stool). At other times, the lymphatic tissue in the appendix may swell and block the appendix. Bacteria which normally are found within the appendixthen begin to invade (infect) the wall of the appendix. The body responds to theinvasion by mounting an attack on the bacteria, an attack called inflammation.(An alternative theory for the cause of appendicitis is an initial rupture ofthe appendix followed by spread of bacteria outside the appendix.. The cause ofsuch a rupture is unclear, but it may relate to changes that occur in thelymphatic tissue that line the wall of the appendix.)", "doctor_answer": "An infection and inflamation of the appendix.\n\nThe appendix is a little appendage hanging off your intestines.

When the baby was in the womb, the mother's liver took care of the excess pigment (called bilirubin) in the blood that causes jaundice. It takes a while for the baby's liver to be able to process and eliminate it. \n\nMild cases can be treated by exposing baby briefly to sunlight and making sure baby is getting plenty of fluids (breastmilk is best).  More severe cases can be treated by your pediatrician using special light therapy.", "doctor_answer": "What is jaundice? \nJaundice is an illness that can happen in the first few days of a baby's life. It turns your baby's skin, eyes and mouth a yellow color. The yellow color is caused by bilirubin.\n\nBilirubin is made when the body breaks down old red blood cells. This is a normal process that happens all through life. Bilirubin goes to the liver, where it is changed again. Then it goes into the intestines and the kidneys, and then it goes out of the body. If too much bilirubin builds up in your baby's body, it makes a yellow color called jaundice (say: \"john-diss\").\n\nJaundice is common in babies and is usually not serious.\n\nWhy do some babies get jaundice? \nRed blood cells have a shorter life in babies than they do in adults. This means more bilirubin goes through your baby's liver. If your baby's skin is bruised during birth, more red cells may need to be broken down. Then your baby's liver has to handle even more bilirubin. Sometimes a baby's liver is not mature enough to handle the extra bilirubin.\n\n\nHow can I tell if my baby has jaundice? \nYou should watch for color changes in your baby's skin. You should also check the whites of your baby's eyes and the pink skin inside your baby's mouth. If they get yellowish, you may want to see your baby's doctor. If your baby has pale skin, it should look white when you gently press it with your fingertips. If the skin looks yellow, your baby may have jaundice. If your baby has darker skin, it may be harder to check, except by looking at your baby's eyes and inside your baby's mouth.\n\nArtificial light, especially fluorescent lights, can sometimes fool your eyes into seeing a yellow color that is not really there. So you might want to check your baby in daylight in a sunny room.\n\nAs the amount of bilirubin in the blood increases, your baby's body will get more yellow. As the bilirubin level rises, the yellow color can move from your baby's head down to the chest and even down to the toes.\n\nIf your baby's skin is yellow, see your baby's doctor right away. The doctor will take a small amount of your baby's blood and measure the bilirubin in it.\n\n\nHow is jaundice treated? \nIf the bilirubin level is not too high, your baby might not need any treatment. Your doctor might just want you to feed your baby breast milk or formula more often.\n\nIf the bilirubin level is very high or is getting higher very quickly, your baby will need light therapy. This is also called phototherapy. Phototherapy helps to break down bilirubin in your baby's skin.\n\nFor this treatment, your baby is placed under special white, blue or green lights. The baby might also be placed on a special light-producing blanket. Your baby's eyes are covered to protect them from the bright lights. Phototherapy usually lasts for 1 or 2 days.\n\nPhototherapy can give your baby loose stools, temperature problems or dehydration. Your doctor will watch your baby carefully to prevent or treat these problems.\n\nIf your baby's bilirubin level gets too high, and phototherapy does not work well enough, the baby might need an exchange transfusion. In this treatment, some of your baby's blood is taken out, and it is replaced with blood from someone else.\n\n\nCan jaundice hurt my baby? \nJaundice is not a serious problem in most healthy babies. However, very high bilirubin levels can be dangerous. It can give some babies brain damage.\n\nYour doctor will measure your baby's bilirubin level a number of times. If necessary, your baby will be treated. This usually keeps the bilirubin level from getting high enough to hurt your baby.\n\n \n\nHow long will my baby have jaundice? \nJaundice lasts for a different time in different babies. Often, the bilirubin level goes up for the first 3 to 4 days and then slowly goes back down. A baby who is breastfed may have mild jaundice for a longer time than a baby who is formula-fed."}, {"question": "has anyone, EVER personally gotten lockjaw if they didnt get their tetnus shot after getting cut with metal?", "patient_answer": "You are not likely to have to have many personal reports as the dissease is often fatal -- and the fact that the vaccine is effective.

What is bipolar disorder? \n\nBipolar disorder is a common, recurrent, severe psychiatric illness that affects an individual's mood, behavior and ability to think clearly. It occurs in 1% to 2% of the population in the United States. A variant, called bipolar II disorder, is probably even more common and occurs in up to 3% of the general population in this country. \n\n2. What are the differences between bipolar I and bipolar II disorders? \n\nBipolar I disorder is characterized by episodes of mania that alternate with periods of depression or periods in which individuals have simultaneously occurring manic and depressive symptoms called mixed states. In contrast, bipolar II disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and milder symptoms of mania, called hypomania. Hypomanic episodes typically do not impair an individual's ability to function to the extent that full-blown manic episodes do additionally; hypomanic episodes are not complicated by psychotic symptoms. \n\n3. What is rapid cycling? \n\nThe term rapid cycling was originally coined by David Dunner, M.D., and Ron Fieve, M.D., in the 1970s when they identified a group of individuals who did not respond well to lithium. These patients typically had four or more episodes of mania or depression in the 12-month interval prior to lithium treatment. This definition has been adopted formally by DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.) and specifically means the occurrence of four or more mood episodes within the preceding year. In severe cases, rapid cycling can occur even within a one-day period. \n\n4. At what age does bipolar disorder appear? \n\nBipolar disorder most commonly presents in the late teens and early 20s. Unfortunately, for most individuals, lifelong treatment may be required to prevent recurrent manic and depressive episodes. Equally unfortunate is evidence that the illness often goes undiagnosed and untreated for many years; the longer the illness progresses without treatment, the greater the impairment in an individual's psychological, educational and vocational development. Additionally, untreated bipolar disorder carries a high risk of suicide. \n\n5. Is bipolar disorder genetic? \n\nBipolar disorder, among all psychiatric illnesses, may have the greatest genetic contribution. For instance, if an individual has a parent with bipolar disorder, the chance that the individual's child will have bipolar disorder is about nine-fold greater than in the general population, with the risk rising from about 1% to about 10%. The inheritability of this illness is estimated to be anywhere from 50% to 80%. On the other hand, if a person with bipolar disorder is thinking about having children, there are still good odds that the child will not have bipolar illness. So the genetic determinants of the illness are complicated. \n\n6. How is bipolar disorder treated? \n\nThe cornerstone of treatment is medications that treat acute manic, depressive or mixed episodes, and which, in the long run, attempt to prevent the recurrence of these episodes. Such medications include lithium, divalproex (Depakote) and, more recently, some of the atypical antipsychotics as well as antidepressants. \n\nPsychotherapy plays an important role in improving the course and outcome of this illness in people. In particular, those with bipolar disorder often have strained relationships with loved ones because of their experiences during manic or depressive episodes; psychotherapy can help repair these torn relationships. In addition, psychotherapy can educate people about the signs and symptoms of their illness, how to pay attention to warning signs and how to nip emerging episodes in the bud. Psychotherapy can also help individuals cope with the stress that can sometimes precipitate manic or depressive episodes. \n\n7.

A milder form of diphtheria can be limited to the skin. It is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, an aerobic Gram-positive bacterium.\n\nDiphtheria is a highly contagious disease spread by direct physical contact or breathing the secretions of those infected. Diphtheria was once quite common, but has now largely been eradicated in developed nations (in the United States for instance, there have been fewer than 5 cases a year reported since 1980, as the DPT (Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis) vaccine is given to all school children). Boosters of the vaccine are recommended for adults because the benefits of the vaccine decrease with age; they are particularly recommended for those travelling to areas where the disease has not been eradicated yet.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nThe respiratory form has an incubation time of 1-4 days. Symptoms include fatigue, fever, a mild sore throat and problems swallowing. Children infected have symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, chills, and a high fever, although some do not show symptoms until the infection has progressed further.\n\nLow blood pressure may develop in some patients. Longer-term effects include cardiomyopathy and peripheral neuropathy (sensory type)[1].", "doctor_answer": "Diphtheria is a contagious illness caused by a type of bacteria. It can cause breathing and swallowing problems and can damage the heart and central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)."}, {"question": "what is Fifth Disease?", "patient_answer": "It is a infectious disease-mostly kids get--with a rash on feet, hands and mouth--it goes away in about 14 days--no big deal", "doctor_answer": "What is \"fifth disease?\"\n\nFifth disease is a mild rash illness that occurs most commonly in children. The ill child typically has a \"slapped-cheek\" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a \"cold\" a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days.\n\nWhat causes fifth disease?\n\nFifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Pet dogs or cats may be immunized against \"parvovirus,\" but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. Therefore, a child cannot \"catch\" parvovirus from a pet dog or cat, and a pet cat or dog cannot catch human parvovirus B19 from an ill child.\n\nCan adults get fifth disease?\n\nYes, they can. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease.\n\nIs fifth disease contagious?\n\nYes. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash.\n\nHow does someone get infected with parvovirus B19?\n\nParvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to \"just have a cold.\" The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. In a household, as many as 50% of susceptible persons exposed to a family member who has fifth disease may become infected. During school outbreaks, 10% to 60% of students may get fifth disease.\n\nHow soon after infection with parvovirus B19 does a person become ill?\n\nA susceptible person usually becomes ill 4 to 14 days after being infected with the virus, but may become ill for as long as 20 days after infection.\n\nDoes everyone who is infected with parvovirus B19 become ill?\n\nNo. During outbreaks of fifth disease, about 20% of adults and children who are infected with parvovirus B19 do not develop any symptoms. Furthermore, other persons infected with the virus will have a non-specific illness that is not characteristic of fifth disease. Persons infected with the virus, however, do develop lasting immunity that protects them against infection in the future.\n\nHow is fifth disease diagnosed?\n\nA physician can often diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical examination. In cases in which it is important to confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to parvovirus B19 and other germs. If immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to parvovirus B19 is detected, the test result suggests that the person has had a recent infection.\n\nIs fifth disease serious?\n\nFifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy. Joint pain and swelling in adults usually resolve without long-term disability.\n\nParvovirus B19 infection may cause a serious"}, {"question": "Why do i have two holes on my penis? is it normal?", "patient_answer": "hahaha....sounds alien.", "doctor_answer": "I've never heard one with 2 holes,that may not be normal better get that checked out!"}, {"question": "For the guys...Are you aware?", "patient_answer": "Those smells could happen for anyone.

The sudden rush of air into the lungs causes the glottis to close, creating the \"hic\" noise. A bout of hiccups generally resolves by itself, although many home remedies are in circulation to shorten the duration, and medication is occasionally necessary. By extension, the term \"hiccup\" is also used to describe a small and unrepeated aberration in an otherwise consistent pattern. The medical term is singultus.\n\nWhile many cases develop spontaneously, hiccups are known to develop often in specific situations, such as eating too quickly, taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal, eating very hot or spicy food, laughing vigorously or coughing, or drinking an excess of an alcoholic beverage. Hiccups may be caused by pressure to the phrenic nerve by other anatomical structures, or rarely by tumors.", "doctor_answer": "Irrition to your diaphragm causes hiccups. \n\nThe diaphragn pulls down when you inhale to help pull air into the lungs, and it pushes up when you exhale to help push air out of the lungs. \n\nBut when your diaphragm gets irritated it pushes up in a jerky way causing a hiccup."}, {"question": "What is the problem if I work out daily and following that I have no bm for a week.

Since then, it was not detected when I had physicals.  I know many people who were diagnosed with them and they were nothing.\n\nHere's some info from webmd:\n\n\nIn particular, they occur in many healthy children, who may or may not outgrow them as adults. They may also occur during pregnancy. Such murmurs are called \"innocent\" heart murmurs. They are not associated with medical or heart conditions, and do not require treatment or lifestyle changes.\n\n\nThough many murmurs are innocent, some may indicate serious heart problems. For instance, heart murmurs may be caused by blood flowing through a heart valve made leaky or narrow by disease. Murmurs can also be caused by increased blood flow across a valve as a result of medical conditions such as anemia or hypothyroidism. Congenital cardiac defects (heart problems present at birth) can also cause heart murmurs. These often can be repaired with surgery.\n\nWithin the heart there are four chambers separated from each other by valves, or flaps, that regulate how much blood enters each chamber at any time. Healthy valves also help prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction in your heart.\n\nA healthy heart makes a \"lub-dub\" sound as it beats. The \"lub\" (systolic sound) happens when part of the heart contracts and the mitral and tricuspid valves close, and the \"dub\" (diastolic sound) occurs when part of the heart relaxes and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. A heart murmur is an extra sound, such as a whooshing, in the heartbeat caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves.\n\nHeart murmurs can be heard through a stethoscope and often are detected during routine physical examinations. On further examination, your doctor may find that the heart murmur is innocent. If your heart murmur is related to more serious heart problems, your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist). Medication or surgery may be recommended to treat the underlying problem. He or she may also suggest that you take extra precautions against getting a heart infection, such as by taking antibiotics when you have dental work or some surgeries. With thorough examination and proper tests, your doctor should be able to tell what causes your heart murmur.\n\nSymptoms\nMany people with heart murmurs experience no symptoms. However, some murmurs can occur in conjunction with these other symptoms:\n\n    * Chest pain\n    * Rapid heartbeat (palpitations)\n    * Breathlessness\n    * Fatigue\n    * Bluish skin color or fingertips (sometimes seen in babies with congenital heart defects)", "doctor_answer": "it is a hole in the heart"}, {"question": "what is aids (hiv), what is hiv?", "patient_answer": "AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, rarely written Aids) is a disease characterized by the destruction of the human immune system.

It is important to build a good relationship with your doctor, so you can decide what option is best for you. \n\nPain Medication \n\nFor some women with mild symptoms, no further treatment other than medication for pain may be needed. For women with minimal endometriosis who want to become pregnant, doctors are saying that, depending on the age of the woman and her amount of pain from the disease, the best thing to do is to have a trial period of unprotected sex for six months to one year. If she does not get pregnant in that time, then further treatment may be needed. \n\nHormone Treatment \n\nFor patients who do not wish to become pregnant, but need treatment for their disease, their doctors may suggest hormone treatment. Hormone treatment is most effective when growths are small. Hormones can come in pill form, by shot or injection, or in a nasal spray. There are several hormones used for this treatment including a combination of estrogen and progestin such as birth control pills, a progestin alone, Danocrine (a weak male hormone), and GnRH agonists (gonadotropin releasing hormone). \n\nBirth control pills control the growth of the tissue that lines the uterus and often decrease the amount of menstrual flow. They usually contain two hormones, estrogen and progestin. Once a woman stops taking them, the ability to become pregnant returns, but the symptoms of endometriosis also may return. Some women take birth control pills continuously, without using the sugar pills that signal the body to go through menstruation. When birth control pills are taken in this way, the menstrual period may stop altogether, which can reduce pain or get rid of it entirely. Some birth control pills contain only progestin, a progesterone-like hormone. Women who can't take estrogen use these pills to reduce menstrual flow. With these pills, some women may not have pain for several years after stopping treatment. All birth control pills might cause some mild side effects like weight gain, bleeding between periods, and bloating. \n\nDanocrine has become a more common treatment choice than either progestin or combination hormone pills. Side effects with Danocrine include oily skin, pimples or acne, weight gain, muscle cramps, tiredness, smaller breasts, breast tenderness, headaches, dizziness, weakness, hot flashes, or a deepening of the voice. Women on Danocrine probably will only get a period now and then, or might not get it at all. Women who take Danocrine also should take steps to prevent pregnancy because it can harm a baby growing in the uterus. Because other hormones, like birth control pills, should be avoided, health care providers recommend that you use condoms, a diaphragm, or other \"barrier\" methods to prevent pregnancy. \n\nGnRH agonists (used daily in a nose spray, or as an injection given once a month or every three months) prevent the body from making certain hormones to prevent menstruation. Without menstruation, the growth of endometriosis is slowed or stopped. These medications can cause side effects, such as hot flashes, tiredness, problems sleeping, headaches, depression, bone loss, and vaginal dryness. Most health care providers recommend that a woman stay on a GnRH agonist for about six months. After that time, the body will start having a period again and a woman could get pregnant. But, after that time, about half of women have some return of their endometriosis symptoms. \n\nSurgery \n\nSurgery is usually the best choice for women with extensive endometriosis, or those with severe pain. There are both minor and major surgeries that can help. Your doctor might suggest one of the following surgical treatments: \n\nLaparoscopy - also used to diagnose the disease, your doctor can treat you with this surgery as well. If your doctor is going to treat the endometriosis during this surgery, he or she must make at least tw", "doctor_answer": "Pregnancy. However, it's hard to get pregnant when you have endometriosis. Be careful with Lupron Depot it lowers your hormones which can cause bone problems.\n\nYou can also have surgery to remove them but they'll just come back.

If you wait too long for pregnancy it may not happen.\n\nStay hopeful and prayerful."}, {"question": "what are the duties of GYNAECOLOGIST?", "patient_answer": "Some of the more common operations that gynaecologists perform include:\n\ntermination of pregnancy \ndilation and curettage (removal of the uterine contents, for various reasons, including miscarriage and menorrhagia; procedurally very similar to the above); \nhysterectomy (removal of the uterus); \noophorectomy (removal of the ovaries); \ntubal ligation; \nExploratory laporoscopy or laporotomy (used to diagnose and treat sources of pelvic and abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, vaginal bleeding, etc.) \ncolposuspension ('tightening' of the ligaments around the vagina, a common therapy for incontinence and discomfort in older women); \nLarge Loop Excision of the Transition Zone (LLETZ), where the surface of the cervix, containing pre-cancerous cells identified on Pap smear are removed).", "doctor_answer": "Gynaecology is a typically a consultant specialty. In most countries, women must see a general practitioner first. If their condition requires knowledge or equipment unavailable to the GP, they are referred to a gynaecologist. However, in the United States, law and many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care, and some women select that option.\n\nAs in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history and examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, and that it involves special equipment -- the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus and ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. Virgins are not usually examined vaginally. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigations\nSome of the investigations used in gynaecology are:\n\nabdominal ultrasound, to give a low-power view of the pelvic organs. \nvaginal ultrasound. A probe is passed into the vagina, which allows a detailed view of the uterus and its contents. \nblood tests. Levels of hormones such as estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and progesterone are measured, as well as prolactin. \nhysteroscopy -- a fine tube is passed into the uterus via the cervix under a general anaesthetic. \nlaparoscopy -- tubes are passed into the peritoneal cavity, which is then insufflated with carbon dioxide. This is commonly used to diagnose endometriosis. \nMRI and CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare. It can be used to delineate the uterine cavity with an injected dye (hysterosalpingogram) and to measure the pelvic girdle.\n\n\nDiseases\nThe main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are:\n\ncancer of the cervix. The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is a means of detecting this, by obtaining a sample of cervical epithelial cells and examining them under a microscope for malignant changes. All women are encouraged to have pap smears at regular intervals after commencing intercourse. \nincontinence of urine. \namenorrhoea (absent periods) \ndysmenorrhoea (painful periods) \ninfertility \nmenorrhagia (heavy periods).

Nor does everyone know from a very young age that they want to transition and not every transsexual hates the body they were born with.  There are complicated reasons other than that related to an individual's desire to transition.  Transsexuals can be heterosexual, gay, lesbian, bisexual, or any other sexuality.  Eventually however their bodies will reflect their gender with the help of the methods listed above and this new body is different from the sexed term assigned to the body  and the person at birth.", "doctor_answer": "I just want to clear up some misconceptions here:\n\nA transsexual is a person who self-identifies as a person of the opposite sex from what they were born as.  Both male-to-female and female-to-male transexuals exist, but MTF is more common.\n\nIt takes hormone therapy and surgery to completely change one's sex.  People who choose to undergo the transistion are often required to live with their new identity for a year before doctors will allow any surgery to be done.  People who have not had the surgery are called pre-op transexuals, as opposed to post-op.\n\nTransexuality actually has nothing to do with who the person is sexually attracted to, only the sexual identity of the person.  This is probably the hardest thing to grasp for non-transexuals as our sexual preference is the most over-riding part of our sexuality.  \n\nWhat Dr. Dee refers to is a pre-op transexual.

HIV is entered through the body through the mucous membranes or thru blood to blood contact. \n\n\nOnce you get the virus it slowly begins to attack the immune system, killing off healthy immune system cells. The deterioration and destruction of immune function leads to AIDS. \n\n\nAIDS is the final stage of the HIV infection. A person is said to have AIDS when the cd4 counts drops below 200 and or a person has 1 or more opportunistic infections. The OIs, as they are called, are normal infections that a healthy person would be able to fight off. \n\n\nThe four stages of the HIV infection are as follows: \n\n\n1) The period following infection is called the window. It is called this because it reflect the window of time between infection and that which antibodies are devlop in a person. The HIV test looks for antibodies not the virus. \n\n\n2) The second stage is called seroconversion. This is when the body begins to develop lots of antibodies to fight off the virus in the body. During this period a person may have flu like sympton. Also during this period is said to be very infectious. \n\n\n3) The third stage is called symptom free. During this period a person may have no sympton what so ever. This can last any where from 6 months to well over ten years.

In the first case, foodstuffs are broken down by enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria in order for the energy in them to be made available to the body. Through the processes of digestion and fermentation, gases can be liberated from what's eaten. In the second case, air that a person swallows from eating, drinking, breathing, chewing gum, and being stressed, among other ways of entry, that's not expelled during a burp travels through the stomach and intestine, transforming into fart-ready mode. In either case, the gases flow down through the rest of the digestive tract and eventually exit the body - Poof! Ping! Pfft! Toot-toot! Kaboom! - expelled as a fart, or farts. And this silent or noisy expulsion of air can help bring about some relief and comfort from a buildup of gas within the lower part of the body.\"", "doctor_answer": "What exactly is a fart? The word \"fart\" can stand for: Frequency Actuated Rectal Tremor. Farting, also known as flatulence, is the act of passing intestinal gas from the butt.

The benefit is that since some of the tissue had broken down when you work out the next day you rely on other tissue  that has not broken down in the muscle group to raise the weight that you are raising. The muscle will eventually get bulkier if you do it that way and it will be pretty painful because the tissue will eventually be broken down.

Practitioners draw on \"reiki energy\" channeling it to areas of need in themselves and their patients.

The patient lies clothed on a treatment table and the practitioner holds his hands on or over the body in 12 basic positions for about five minutes each.

Strabismus can be constant (meaning the eyes are always crossed or misaligned) or intermittent (meaning it happens now and then).\n\nWhat is amblyopia?\nAmblyopia (also called lazy eye) develops when the brain shuts off or suppresses vision in one eye.

They are grouped in two ways. One way is by how quickly the disease develops and gets worse. The other way is by the type of blood cell that is affected.\n\nLeukemia is either acute or chronic. In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are blasts that remain very immature and cannot carry out their normal functions. The number of blasts increases rapidly, and the disease becomes worse quickly. In chronic leukemia, some blast cells are present, but in general, these cells are more mature and can carry out some of their normal functions. Also, the number of blasts increases less rapidly than in acute leukemia. As a result, chronic leukemia worsens gradually.\n\nLeukemia can arise in either of the two main types of white blood cells: lymphoid cells or myeloid cells. When leukemia affects lymphoid cells, it is called lymphocytic leukemia. When myeloid cells are affected, the disease is called myeloid or myelogenous leukemia.\n\nThese are the most common types of leukemia:\n\n1.Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. This disease also affects adults, especially those age 65 and older. \n2.Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in both adults and children. This type of leukemia is sometimes called acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). \n3.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most often affects adults over the age of 55. It sometimes occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. \n4.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurs mainly in adults. A very small number of children also develop this disease. \n5.Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon type of chronic leukemia. This and other uncommon types of leukemia are not discussed here.

My uncle had to stop soda altogether because of this (good luck!):\n\nAn ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. \n\nThere are two main types of ulcers- \n\nPeptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. \n\nDuodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. \n\nHow do you know if you have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. \n\nIntense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. \n\nThere may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. \n\nThere are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium \"H. pylori\" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. \n\nSome medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding. \n\nTense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. \"The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide\" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. \n\nAlthough uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. \n\n\n\nWhen a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage. \n\nIf you find the above mentioned symptoms, contact the doctor. Immediate medical attention should be given if the patient is vomiting blood, has cold skin accompanied by sweating, faintness, weakness, or is experiencing extreme pain. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for prompt healing and also to prevent the ulcer from coming back. \n\nThe above is provided for your information, but you are responsible for your own actions to deal with your ulcers or gastro esophageal health problems.

Unfortunately there is no way to protect yourself 100% from HPV, although the risk is reduced if a condom is used.  HPV can be active in the skin, even though there are no warts present.  This means that you (or your partner) can have the virus and not even know it.  It stands to reason then, that HPV is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections.  My family doctor told me to just assume that everyone who has had more than 2 sexual partners in his/her lifetime has it.\n\nUPDATE: Based on later answers, I wanted to address mutual m*sterbation.  You CAN get HPV from mutual mast.  HPV warts can be microscopic, invisible to the naked eye.

Commonly a curve may be expressed with the P50  value.  This is a value which tells the pressure at which the erythrocytes are fifty percent saturated with oxygen.  (Bouverot, 1985).  The purpose of an oxygen dissociation curve is to show the equilibrium of oxyhemoglobin and nonbonded hemoglobin at various partial pressures (Oxygen Dissociation Curve).  At high partial pressures of oxygen, usually in the lungs, hemoglobin binds to oxygen to form oxyhemoglobin.  When the blood is fully saturated all the erythrocytes are in the form of oxyhemoglobin.  As the erythrocytes travel to tissues deprived of oxygen the partial pressure of oxygen will decrease.  Consequently, the oxyhemoglobin releases the oxygen to form hemoglobin (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997).  \n\nThe sigmoid shape of the oxygen dissociation curve is a result of the cooperative binding of oxygen to the four polypeptide chains.  Cooperative binding is the characteristic of a hemoglobin to have a greater ability to bind oxygen after a subunit has bound oxygen (Oxygen Dissociation Curve).  Thus, hemoglobin is most attracted to oxygen when three of the four polypeptide chains are bound to oxygen.  \n\n \n\nFactors that Influence Oxygen Binding\n\n    *\n\n      Temperature- Increasing the temperature denatures the bond between oxygen and hemoglobin, which increases the amount of oxygen and hemoglobin and decreases the concentration of oxyhemoglobin (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997).  The dissociation curve shifts to the right.\n    *\n\n      pH- A decrease in pH (increase in acidity) by addition of carbon dioxide or other acids causes a Bohr Shift.  A Bohr. shift is characterized by causing more oxygen to be given up as oxygen pressure increases and it is more pronounced in animals of smaller size due to the increase in sensitivity to acid (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997).  The dissociation curve shifts to the right.\n    *\n\n      Organic Phospates- 2,3-Diphosphoglycerated (DPG) is the primary organic phosphate in mammals.  DPG binds to hemoglobin which rearranges the hemoglobin into the T-state, thus decreasing the affinity of oxygen for hemoglobin (T and R State).  The curve shifts to the right.", "doctor_answer": "The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is an important tool for understanding how our blood carries and releases oxygen. Specifically, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve relates oxygen saturation (SO2) and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PO2), and is determined by what is called \"hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen,\" that is, how readily hemoglobin acquires and releases oxygen molecules from its surrounding tissue."}, {"question": "What is the true color of our Blood?", "patient_answer": "In humans and other hemoglobin-using creatures, oxygenated blood is a bright red in color. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red, which can be seen during blood donation and when venous blood samples are taken. However, due to an optical effect caused by the way in which light penetrates through the skin, veins typically appear blue in color. This has led to a common misconception that before venous blood is exposed to air it is blue.", "doctor_answer": "the blood whke in the body is blue because i has not hit oxygen. when you get cut and it hits oxygen it than turns red."}, {"question": "What is pre-Hipertension?", "patient_answer": "Hypertension (defined as a blood pressure >=140/90 mmHg) is an extremely common comorbid condition in diabetes, affecting ~20–60% of patients with diabetes, depending on obesity, ethnicity, and age. In type 2 diabetes, hypertension is often present as part of the metabolic syndrome of insulin resistance also including central obesity and dyslipidemia. In type 1 diabetes, hypertension may reflect the onset of diabetic nephropathy. Hypertension substantially increases the risk of both macrovascular and microvascular complications, including stroke, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, and possibly neuropathy. In recent years, adequate data from well-designed randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of aggressive treatment of hypertension in reducing both types of diabetes complications.\n\n\nIf your blood pressure is between 120/80 mmHg and 139/89 mmHg, then you have PREHYPERTENSION. This means that you don't have high blood pressure now but are likely to develop it in the future.

Each cell is so small you would need a powerful microscope for looking at 100 of them.\n\nAll cells are surrounded by a membrane.  Somewhat like a very, very tiny balloon filled with salty jello.  The insides of the outermost cells are salty and dehydrated because your skin grows from underneath, the dermis, close to the capillaries (blood supply).\n\nThe outer skin, called the epidermis, consists of cells which are wearing out and drying up, although they are mostly not quite dead yet.  The very oldest ones that are dead come off when you scrub or shower. Some are falling off all the time, but they are so small you do not see them.\n\nSince the epidermis consists of rather dry cells, it is able to absorb water.  The cell walls allow the water in your tub, shower, or pool to penetrate into each cell.  The insides, being salty, are have a strong affinity for water.  \n\nIf you spend a long time in the water, the epidermal cells swell up, increasing in size, somewhat like the the balloons mentioned earlier being filled with more water.\n\nWhen the skin on the outside of your hands or toes swells it has more surface area than previously.  Instead of being like a tight fitting glove, it becomes more like a glove that is too big.\n\nIf you put on a glove that is too big, it will have wrinkles instead of being stretched smoothly.\n\nThe entry of water into a cell is called osmosis.  If you stay in fresh water for an extremely long time, many cells will absorb so much water they will burst.  That is called lysis.\n\nRed blood cells are much more fragile than skin cells.  When combined with fresh water they rapidly absorb so much water that they all appear to dissolve.  Each one of the millions and millions of red blood cells has burst.  That is called hemolysis.\n\nRopes made from plant fibers are also composed of cells.  Test a rope:  See if it shrinks in length when absorbing water or drying out.\n\nWhen the skin on your fingers and toes dries out, the cells shrink in size, and the skin becomes more smooth and taut, like a tight, well fitted glove.\n\nYour skin is very important.  Without it you would be just like a raw piece of meat, ready for the flies and germs to eat.\n\nTake good care of your skin.  Do not get sunburned.  When you have a bad cut that is healing, you should try to keep your hands out of dirty water or ponds.\nThese contain potentially dangerous bacteria that could infect your open or healing wound.\n\nTaking a shower or washing your hands in clean water is okay.  Just be sure to put antibiotic ointment and a fresh bandage over the cut when you are done.\n\nYour teacher might be able to show you some pictures of bacteria (germs) or let you look at live ones through a microscope.  \n\nOnly one person is allowed to look through at a time.  Everyone else must stand back and not push the observer or touch their head.  Otherwise you could injure one of their eyes or both by knocking them into the eyepiece or binoculars of the microscope.\n\nSome people have gone blind that way.  No horsing around !!  Strictly enforced.\n\nDuring winter, good skin care means putting lotion on your hands and wearing gloves while outside in the cold winter air.\n\nPeople who drink a carrot milkshake daily, made in a blender, have very beautiful skin once they have done this for six months.\n\nHealthy skin makes both boys and girls look better."}, {"question": "on october i used the emergency injection to prevent pregnancy, i got my period until november, can i start on", "patient_answer": "Im not sure what the end of this question was but if you were curious about when you can start birth control you can start as soon as your period starts again regularly or when the blleding from the injection stops then go to the doctor take a pregnancy test if no baby start birth control if you were worried about when to have sex again whenever you are ready", "doctor_answer": "check with your doctor."}, {"question": "how fast can i see results from doing sit ups?", "patient_answer": "First, you should stick with crunches..they are less stressful on your back and focus more on the correct muscles.

That is, if you are doing a serious ab routinue of at least 25 minutes/day (with 1 day off a week).\nIf you have a not-so-healthy eating lifestyle, doing sit ups will not help and you will most likely not see any results unless you are doing a complete ab workout (obliques, crunches, roman chair, scissors, leg lifts, etc.) for at least 2 hours/day. \nThe best way is to cut fat (soda, junk food are the easiest) and gradually build into a harder and harder workout where you start at 3 sets of 30 sit ups for a week and add one set and 10 reps per set every week. In ten weeks, you will have a solid workout that will produce very good results. With every workout routine, you should be doing a cardio-vascular exercise (running, biking, brisk walking) to burn calories.

Constipation can be attributed to at least one of several factors: poor eating habits, lack of exercise, not eating enough fiber or drinking enough fluids, and even possibly serious illness.\n\nFortunately, there are things one can do to prevent constipation.\n\nSince dehydration can lead to constipation, one should always drink at least eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day. It’s best to avoid caffeine since it causes dehydration and can act as a diuretic. Those who do enjoy caffeinated beverages on a regular basis should do so in moderation.\n\nA healthy diet is key for preventing constipation. A high fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts ensures regularity. Consuming an apple every day, with its skin intact, is another sure way to prevent constipation. Guava is another helpful fruit, but it should be eaten with its seeds to ensure the full effect. Starchy foods should be avoided when one is constipated as this will only escalate the problem.\n\nRegular exercise will also assist in one’s quest for regularity. Even if it’s a daily stroll in the park, exercise is important.\n\nIf you’re feeling a little backed up, perhaps one or some of these remedies can help.\n\nLaxatives – There are many over the counter products to choose from in price ranges and formulas to suit everyone’s personal preference. If you’re not sure which product is right for you, check with your pharmacist or physician. Either is sure to recommend the product that is right for you. \nLemon and Honey – Mix two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of honey into a glass of warm water. Drink one glass in the morning and one in the evening to bring back regularity. \nOrange Juice and Olive Oil – Drink a glass or mug filled with half each of orange juice and olive oil. It may not taste great but it will have your plumbing running smoothly in no time. \nLicorice – Licorice has laxative qualities. Eating several pieces of real licorice will help to relieve your constipation. \nGrapes – A large bunch of grapes should do the trick. \nCastor oil and honey – Honey seems to appear in many remedies for constipation. In addition to taking it with lemon and even by itself, one can also mix one teaspoon of honey with one teaspoon of castor oil. \nSomething else a person who is suffering from constipation can try is a cup of tomato juice mixed with half a cup of sauerkraut juice and a quarter cup of carrot juice. It may not have a pleasant flavor, but it works great!\nWhen it comes to constipation, the important thing is to have a proper diet, drink water often throughout the day, and exercise on a regular basis.

Other diagnostic tests use probes to acquire measurements from parts of the body, or counters for the measurement of samples taken from the patient. In therapy, radionuclides are administered to treat disease or provide palliative pain relief. For example, administration of iodine-131 is often used for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis and thyroid cancer.\n\nNuclear medicine imaging tests differ from most other imaging modalities in that the tests primarily show the physiological function of the system being investigated as opposed to the anatomy. In some centres, the nuclear medicine images can be superimposed on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight which part of the body the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated in. This practice is often referred to as image fusion.\n\nNuclear medicine diagnostic tests are usually provided by a dedicated department within a hospital and may include facilities for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. The specific name of a department can vary from hospital to hospital, with the most common names being the nuclear medicine department and the radioisotope department.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine", "doctor_answer": "it consist of Radiation therapy to Nuclear body imaging studies.\n\nthey use molecular level of study to find out the disease or treatment modalitis."}, {"question": "Is it possible to become infertile after having a hernea removed?", "patient_answer": "No, unless something went very wrong during surgery.

Mix 10 drops of any of the oils with 2 tbsp. soy or almond oil, and smooth a few drops on dampened skin.\n \n6. Try using herbs. Saw palmetto can help balance boys' hormones, while chaste tree berry can do the same for girls. Echinacea, alfalfa, burdock root, cayenne, chaparral and yellow dock root are also helpful.\n \n7.

Some family members may be affected, but a clear genetic pattern is often difficult to establish.\n\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain. There appear to be complex defects in the liver's uptake of plasma bilirubin, which usually fluctuates between 2 and 5 mg/dL (34 and 86 µmol/L) and tends to increase with fasting and other stresses. In addition, glucuronyl transferase activity is low; therefore, the disorder may be related to Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II. Many patients also have mildly diminished RBC survival, but this is insufficient to explain the hyperbilirubinemia.\n\nGilbert's syndrome can be easily differentiated from hepatitis by normal liver function tests, absence of urinary bile, and predominantly unconjugated bilirubin fractionation. Hemolysis is differentiated by the absence of anemia or reticulocytosis. Liver histology is normal, but biopsy is not needed for diagnosis. Patients should be reassured that they do not have liver disease.", "doctor_answer": "According to WebMD.com, Gilbert Syndrome is \"one of a benign (harmless) group of metabolic abnormalities, Gilbert Syndrome is a hereditary disorder leading to a defect in the clearance (removal) of bile pigment (bilirubin) from the liver.

Delve into your daily fluid needs to learn how your body uses water and what factors may increase — or decrease — your water requirements.\n\nLack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry on normal functions. Even mild dehydration — as little as a 1 percent to 2 percent loss of your body weight — can sap your energy and make you tired. Dehydration poses a particular health risk for the very young and the very old. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include:\n\nExcessive thirst \nFatigue \nHeadache \nDry mouth \nLittle or no urination \nMuscle weakness \nDizziness \nLightheadedness \n\nEvery day you lose water through sweating — noticeable and unnoticeable — exhaling, urinating and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you need to replace this water by consuming beverages and foods that contain water. So how much water, or more precisely fluid, do you need?\n\nThis isn't an easy question to answer. A healthy adult's daily fluid intake can vary widely. Most people drink fluid to quench thirst, to supply perceived water needs and \"out of habit.\" At least three approaches estimate total fluid (water) needs for healthy, sedentary adults living in a temperate climate.\n\nReplacement approach. The average urine output for adults is 1.5 liters a day. You lose close to an additional liter of water a day through breathing, sweating and bowel movements. Food usually accounts for 20 percent of your fluid intake, so you if you consume 2 liters of water or other beverages a day (a little more than 8 cups), along with your normal diet, you can replace the lost fluids. \nEight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Another approach to water intake is the \"8 x 8 rule\" — drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day (about 1.9 liters). The rule could also be stated, \"drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day,\" as all fluids count toward the daily total. Though this approach isn't supported by scientific evidence, many people use this basic rule as a guideline for how much water and other fluids to drink. \nDietary recommendations. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day and women consume 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages a day. These guidelines are based on national food surveys that assessed people's average fluid intakes.", "doctor_answer": "I have to disagree with most of the people I guess.

General comments\n\nThe complex of anatomy of the vertebral column and the great concentration of important tracts in a structure of small cross-sectional area are unique features related to spinal cord injury. A number of factors influence the severity of pathological changes and functional deficits after spinal cord trauma, including age and the flexibility of the body, the size of the bony canal as influenced by heredity, degenerative changes of joints and intravertebral discs and variations in blood supply. The spinal levels most commonly involved with injury are the lower cervical spine (C4, C5, C6, C7, T1) and the thoracolumbar juncture (T12, L1, L2), the areas of greater mobility. \n\nB. Pathophysiology\n\n1. The spinal cord and nerve roots may be injured by: \n\na. Compression from bone, ligaments, extruded disc material and tumors. \n\nb. Disruption or overstretching of neural tissues \n\nc. Edema following compression or concussion \n\nd. Disturbance of circulation \n\n\n2. Mechanisms of injury \n\n\na. Direct injury results from force applied directly to the back of the neck or trunk and may cause fractures of spinous processes of laminal arches, concussion of the spinal cord, or direct compression of neural tissue by depressed bone fragments. Lacerations can result from knife or bullet wounds. \n\n\nb. Indirect injury is a more common mechanism resulting from forces applied to the head and trunk or from movements that exceed the normal range, e.g. when the head is suddenly accelerated or decelerated in relation to the trunk. \n\nC. Pathological changes \n\nThe most common pathological changes are contusions, with necrosis, swelling and hemorrhage acutely to variable extents. Chronic changes include macrophages, gliosis and loss of architecture. In addition, edema may occur in areas that do not show contusions and infarction may result from impairment of circulation. Wallerian degeneration in distal axons will occur. \n\nD. Clinical signs\n\nNeurological symptoms vary from complete loss of function below the injured segments to temporary loss of cord function with complete recovery. Specific symptoms depend on the site of injury. e.g. posterior horn or column injury produces paresthesias, pain and other sensory disturbances; anterior horn or corticospinal tract damage results in weakness or paralysis. After denervation, fibrillations, fasciculations, muscle atrophy, and groups of atrophic fibers in a muscle biopsy will be seen. \n\nE. Types of injury\n\n1. Fracture dislocation of the spine \n\n2. Hyperextension or hyperflexion with cord compression by a displaced vertebral body fragment. \n\n3. Cervical spondylosis \n\n4. Intervertebral disc abnormalities and other osseous pathology, e.g. herniated lumbar disc \n\n5. Neoplasms (intramedullary or extramedullary)", "doctor_answer": "spinal cord \n\nThe spinal cord is a part of the vertebrate nervous system that is enclosed in and protected by the vertebral column (it passes through the spinal canal). It consists of nerve cells. The cord conveys the 31 spinal nerve pairs of the peripheral nervous system, as well as central nervous system pathways that innervate skeletal muscles.\n\nThe vertebral column consists of vertebrae described as belonging to 5 groups (called segments). These segments are (in order from top to bottom): the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae, and the sacrum and coccyx"}, {"question": "What is the EASIEST way to loose weight for a female.

Headache, like chest pain or back ache, has many causes. \n\nAll headaches are considered primary headaches or secondary headaches. Primary headaches are not associated with other diseases. Examples of primary headaches are migraine headaches, tension headaches, and cluster headaches. Secondary headaches are caused by other diseases. The associated disease may be minor or major. \n\nTension headaches are the most common type of primary headache. As many as 90% of adults have tension headaches. Tension headaches are more common among women than men. \n\nMigraine headaches are the second most common type of primary headache. An estimated 28 million people in the US have migraine headaches. Migraine headaches affect children as well as adults. Before puberty, boys and girls are affected equally by migraine headaches, but after puberty more women than men have them. Migraine often goes undiagnosed or is misdiagnosed as tension or sinus headaches. \n\nCluster headaches are a rare but important type of primary headache, affecting mainly men. The average age of cluster headache sufferers is 28-30 years, although headaches may begin in childhood. \n\nSecondary headaches may result from innumerable conditions, ranging from life threatening ones such as brain tumors, strokes, meningitis, and subarachnoid hemorrhages to less serious but common conditions such as withdrawal from caffeine and discontinuation of analgesics (pain killing medication). Many people suffer from \"mixed\" headache disorders in which tension headaches or secondary headaches may trigger migraine. \n\n\nStomach ache:\n\nPain in the belly (abdomen) can come from conditions affecting a variety of organs. The abdomen is an anatomical area that is bounded by the lower margin of the ribs above, the pelvic bone (pubic ramus) below, and the flanks on each side. Although abdominal pain can arise from the tissues of the abdominal wall that surround the abdominal cavity (i.e., skin and abdominal wall muscles), the term abdominal pain generally is used to describe pain originating from organs within the abdominal cavity (i.e., beneath the skin and muscles). These organs include the stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Occasionally, pain may be felt in the abdomen even though it is arising from organs that are close to but not within the abdominal cavity, for example, the lower lungs, the kidneys, and the uterus or ovaries. This latter type of pain is called \"referred\" pain because the pain, though originating outside the abdomen, is being referred to (felt) in the abdominal area. \n\nAbdominal pain can be acute and sudden in onset, or the pain can be chronic and longstanding. Abdominal pain may be minor and of no great significance, or it can reflect a major problem involving one of the organs in the abdomen. The characteristics of the pain--location, timing, duration, etc. are important in diagnosing its cause.

Fat is created by eating excess calories and it is primarily stored in layers on top of your muscles. Muscle tissue consists of fibers that contract to produce movement.\n\nFat can't turn into muscle, and muscle can't turn into fat. But you can lose muscle mass while you gain fat. That's what happens to most people, especially as they begin to get a little older.\n\nSo if your goal is a trim waist line and a nice flat stomach, the first thing you need to do is remove the layers of fat that are sitting on top of your abs. Everyone has a flat stomach. It's just that some of them are covered with excess fat. \n\nThe most effective way to flatten your stomach is with a combination of strength training (placing an extra focus on the mid-section), cardiovascular exercises (short, intensive workouts), and a stable blood sugar level to keep you from adding even more fat (and it makes it easier for the body to use your body fat for fuel). \nYou have to do some type of progressive strength training. The ab muscle is primarily used to flex your torso forward. But there are also muscles that flex your torso to the side and other muscles that rotate it. Often you will see people on their ab roller every day doing lots of sit-ups or crunches. \n\nIf you want to effectively strengthen your stomach muscles you need to incorporate these exercises: \n  \n1-2 forward flexion exercises (sit-up, crunch, etc.) \n  \n1-2 side flexion exercises (side crunches, side bends, etc.) \n  \n1-2 rotational exercises (standing twists, trunk rotations, etc.)\n  \nYour abs are muscles, and just like any other muscles, they should be exercised at most 3 times per week. You also want to make sure you're training them progressively, which means working them harder each time. \n  \nIncrease metabolism using short, and hard, cardio workouts. Cardio workouts are very important because they can, if done properly, increase your metabolism for up to 24 hours or more!\n\nThis means that you're less likely to store any excess calories as body fat simply because they're more likely to be used up by your higher metabolism. Plus, you're more likely to burn off some excess body fat in the process! \n\nHere's a simple interval workout that you can do with just about any activity (bicycling, walking, swimming, etc).\n  \nWarm up at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes \n  \nPerform 30 seconds of hard exercise (almost as hard as possible) \n  \nperform one minute of moderate exercise (recovery time to catch your breath) \n  \nRepeat this process from 6-10 times \n  \nCool down at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes  \n  \nMaintaining a stable blood sugar level is the key. Most importantly, you have to stabilize your blood sugar level! This is by far the most important factor when it comes to shedding that excess body fat and keeping it off!\n\nTo stabilize your blood sugar level you have to feed your body frequently, about every 2-3 hours. The key is to give your body only the amount of food that it needs at that time. Your body burns calories all day long, so why would you only feed it once or twice a day?\n\nGive your body the fuel it needs: fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins (fish, lean beef, chicken, eggs, etc). \n\nMost people pay too much attention to how much fat is in food, or how healthy a meal is. Calories are calories. It doesn’t matter where they come from. If there’s extra it's going to body fat! \n\nI'm not saying that what you eat isn't important because it is. It just doesn’t have all that much of an affect when it comes to losing fat. Make healthy choices whenever possible, but don’t feel like every cheeseburger you eat is guaranteed to be st"}, {"question": "Can drinking to much water determine the results of the pregnancy test?", "patient_answer": "Sometimes pregnancy tests will not show up positive (even if you are pregnant) if you take it too soon after you got pregnant.

The disease takes its less-scientific name from Lou Gehrig, a baseball player with the New York Yankees in the late 1920s and 1930s, who was forced to retire in 1939 as a result of the loss of motor control caused by the disease. \n\nIn 1991, a team of researchers linked familial ALS to chromosome 21. Two years later, the SOD1 gene was identified as being associated with many cases of familial ALS. The enzyme coded for by SOD1 carries out a very important function in cells: it removes dangerous superoxide radicals by converting them into non-harmful substances. Defects in the action of this enzyme mean that the superoxide radicals attack cells from the inside, causing their death. Several different mutations in this enzyme all result in ALS, making the exact molecular cause of the disease difficult to ascertain.\n\nRecent research has suggested that treatment with drugs called antioxidants may benefit ALS patients.

Constant wetting and drying sucks the moisture from lips' outer layer, causing them to feel dry, which prompts more licking, creating a vicious cycle. Dehydrated lips are also more susceptible to dry, windy conditions. \n-- A moisturizing lip balm, especially those containing dimethicone, will help retain natural moisture and protect dry, chapped lips. \n-- Drinking lots of water will help prevent dehydration, which may contribute to chapped lips and dry skin. \n-- Smoothing a generous coating of lip balm on lips before bed will help to moisturize lips while you sleep. \n-- The sun's UV rays are responsible for 90 percent of visible damage we commonly attribute to aging. A lip balm that contains a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 will help prevent sunburn during outdoor activities, and may reduce the risks of skin aging, skin cancer, and other harmful effects of the sun. \n-- Regular lipstick products, especially some long-wearing varieties, may feel drying. A base coat of lip balm will add needed moisture during winter months. \n-- If lips become chapped, avoid wearing lipsticks while lips are recovering as drying products in color pigments may irritate chapped lips. Also keep acidic foods from touching delicate lips until they've healed. \n-- Lip exfoliators such as Softlips Nightly Care(TM) buff away dry, dead skin cells and stimulate growth of new, vibrant cells. The interactive Beta Hydroxy formula of Softlips Nightly Care(TM) conditions lips that may be sensitive to strong Alpha Hydroxy chemical peels, and the overnight system helps reduce concern about sun damage to freshly exfoliated skin. \n\nFor more information and tips, see the website below!", "doctor_answer": "MEDICATED CHAPSTICK, I PERFER BEES WAX OR BLISTIC, U KNOW ANYTHING LIKE THAT."}, {"question": "help with hives,due to a dye injection before surgery?", "patient_answer": "Was this due to a Contrast Injection givin for an X-ray Procedure such as a CT scan?

An inguinal hernia occurs in the groin (the area between the abdomen and thigh). It is called \"inguinal\" because the intestines push through a weak spot in the inguinal canal, which is a triangle-shaped opening between layers of abdominal muscle near the groin. Obesity, pregnancy, heavy lifting, and straining to pass stool can cause the intestine to push against the inguinal canal.\n\nSymptoms of inguinal hernia may include a lump in the groin near the thigh; pain in the groin; and, in severe cases, partial or complete blockage of the intestine. The doctor diagnoses hernia by doing a physical exam and by taking x rays and blood tests to check for blockage in the intestine.\n\nThe main treatment for inguinal hernia is surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. This surgery is called herniorrhaphy. Sometimes the weak area is reinforced with steel mesh or wire. This operation is called hernioplasty. If the protruding intestine becomes twisted or traps stool, part of the intestine might need to be removed. This surgery is called bowel resection.

Lots of things can enter the equation -- general physical health, type of lung cancer, other health conditions, where it has spread to, treatment choices, age, nutrition, etc.  And it is important to remember that even if the survival rates are low -- you could still be one of the survivors!\n\nI would start by seing a medical oncologist -- ideally one who tends to focus on lung cancers.  They will be in the best position to offer treatment alternatives and outlooks.  Think about what questions you want to answer and write them down before you go.  Take someone with you -- task them with being sure all of your questions get asked and have them take notes.  Don't hesitate to ask the doctor to slow down or provide more information.  If you are interested in prognosis and treatment alternatives -- ask!  Some patients seem to prefer less information in that area and some mds wait for the topic to be brought up.\n\nSome patients fight the disease with everthing medicine has to offer (some of which comes with significant side effects and/or contain invasive techniques).  Other choose to receive no medical treatment.  Still others pick and choose treatments with an eye towards quality of life rather than life extension.\n\nIf you are in the latter category, good questions to ask about any treatment approach (including no treatment) is: a) what is the impact on quality of life; b) what is the impact on life extension; and c) what are the potential side effects and how likely are they.  Regardless of your philosophy, communicate your approach to your doctor.  They are in the business of helping you and they can best meet your needs when they understand what they are.\n\nAlso, please remember that any decisions you make can be reversed -- you can start with very aggresive tx and back off if the disease responds poorly (or your body responds poorly to the tx).  Finally, allow you oncologist to help you with all of the symptoms -- some come from the disease while others can come from the tx.  Don't try and gut it out.  Let you md know about things like depression, anxiety, pain, appetite, nausea.  To some extent, these can be pretty effectively dealt with in the home.\n\nNow is also the time to consider things like what heroic measures you would like taken if you fall very ill and fill out forms such a DPA for health care.

A nurse practitioner provides some care previously offered only by physicians and in most states has the ability to prescribe medications. Working in collaboration with a physician, a nurse practitioner provides high-quality, cost-effective and individualized care for the lifespan of patient's special needs. NPs focus largely on health maintenance, disease prevention, counseling and patient education in a wide variety of settings. With a strong emphasis on primary care, nurse practitioners are employed within several specialties, including neonatology, nurse-midwifery, pediatrics, school health, family and adult health, women's health, mental health, home care, geriatrics and acute care. \nNurse practitioners are educated through programs that grant either a certificate or a master's degree. A registered nurse is recommended to have extensive clinical experience before applying to a nurse practitioner program. An intensive preceptorship under the direct supervision of a physician or an experienced nurse practitioner, as well as instruction in nursing theory, are key components to most NP programs. physician assistants (PAs) are non-physicians licensed to practice medicine with a physician's supervision. This supervision, in most cases, need not be direct or on site and many PAs practice in remote or underserved areas in satellite clinics. PAs can treat patients and, in most states, prescribe medicine, and in some states in the US they carry a DEA number that gives them authority to prescribe controlled medications like narcotics. PAs in surgical practices also serve as first assists in surgery. PAs provide medical services that are reimbursed under Medicare and third party insurances. Physician assistants and Nurse Practitioners both provide similar services in most states, the major distinction being that nurse practitioners are registered nurses by trade. Both are also known as Advanced Practice Clinicians (APCs) or mid-level practitioners (MLPs)."}, {"question": "red dots on hands?", "patient_answer": "STIGMATA\n\nj/k lol", "doctor_answer": "That could be many different skin conditions depending on exactly how those dots look.

Most testicular cancers are found by men themselves, either as a painless lump, a hardening or change in size of the testicle, or pain in the testicle. Children born with an undescended testicle have an increased risk of getting testicular cancer, regardless of whether surgery is done to correct the problem.

The disorder most commonly begins between ages 20 and 40, but can strike at any age.\n\nThe exact cause is not known, but MS is believed to result from damage to the myelin sheath, the protective material which surrounds nerve cells. It is a progressive disease, meaning the damage gets worse over time. Inflammation destroys the myelin, leaving multiple areas of scar tissue (sclerosis). The inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system.\n\nThe inflammation causes nerve impulses to slow down or become blocked, leading to the symptoms of MS. Repeated episodes, or flare ups, of inflammation can occur along any area of the brain and spinal cord.\n\nSymptoms vary because the location and extent of each attack varies. Usually episodes that last days, weeks, or months alternate with times of reduced or no symptoms (remission).\n\nRecurrence (relapse) is common although non-stop progression without periods of remission may also occur.\n\nResearchers are not sure what triggers an attack. Patients with MS typically have a higher number of immune cells than a healthy person, which suggests that an immune response might play a role. The most common theories point to a virus or genetic defect, or a combination of both. There also appears to be a genetic link to the disease. MS is more likely to occur in northern Europe, the northern United States, southern Australia, and New Zealand than in other areas. Geographic studies indicate there may be an environmental factor involved.\n\nPeople with a family history of MS and those who live in a geographical area with a higher incidence rate for MS have a higher risk of the disease.\n\nCheck out this article with excellent illustrations:\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000737.htm", "doctor_answer": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the Central Nervous System (CNS) - that's the brain and spinal cord.

Thirst is often associated with a dry unpleasant-tasting mouth and the feeling of a need to obtain water; it can result from dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, pharmacologic agents, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids. Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid. Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers. Although nurses are commonly confronted with client complaints of thirst, there has been minimal nursing research that relates to assessment of thirst and drinking behaviors, nursing diagnoses for thirst, or nursing interventions for persons with altered thirst or drinking behaviors.\n\nThirst is the sensation indicating the body's need for water. Dry or salty food and dry, dusty air may induce such a sensation by depleting moisture in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Relief through ingestion of water is only temporary, however, if thirst results from a generalized depletion of water in the system. About three fourths of the body is composed of fluids, and the average adult requires 21/2 qt (2.4 liters) of fluid per day, supplied by water, other beverages, and foods. Depriving the body of water interferes with its metabolism and functions, causing dehydration, which is eventually fatal. The unnatural thirst that accompanies fever, diabetes, and other disorders is caused by a rapid reduction of the body fluids. The sensation of thirst is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus in the brain. Dehydration of the cells triggers the posterior pituitary to releast the antidiuretic hormone (ADH).", "doctor_answer": "To put it simply, you loose water, it concentrates your blood and your brain detects this concentration (osmolality) and sends a signal to drink and to also limit excretion of water.

But what happens exactly? Let's look at the dynamics of fertility and conception.\n\nDuring your menstrual cycle, there are far more infertile days than fertile days. The fertile days are days when there is a possibility for conceiving. However, within your fertile period - the window of opportunity for conception - there are days of \"peak fertility\". Identifying these peak times, and planning accordingly, can help maximize your chances of becoming pregnant.\n\nThe Dynamics of Fertility\nA woman's fertile period during her menstrual cycle, on average, lasts about 9 days. The most fertile period consists of the few days before ovulation. There are a number of reasons why this is the most fertile time. First of all, the amount of cervical fluid increases - and the consistency of the mucus changes substantially (from being sticky and cloudy to becoming transparent, white, and slippery). The purpose of this change is to create a healthy medium for the sperm to survive and travel in. Given a fertile environment, sperm can live several days. The egg, on the other hand, can live only 24 hours - so timing is important. At the moment of ovulation, the body temperature begins to rise to create a warmer, more hospitable environment for a fertilized egg. Also, the cervix will start to rise, soften, and begin to open up.\n\nHormones and Ovulation: The Release of the Egg\nDuring ovulation, a number of different hormonal changes take place. Early in the menstrual cycle, a hormone called Follicle Stimulating Hormone - or FSH - enables your ovaries to nurture eggs. Within the ovaries, follicles house each individual developing egg. The follicles that hold the eggs will secrete estrogen. As the menstrual cycle progresses, the follicle containing the developing egg moves toward the surface of the ovary. Immediately before ovulation, the follicle begins secreting estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen helps the uterine lining thicken and expand, and increases blood flow to the uterus. Progesterone causes the glands of the uterine lining to form secretions that help nourish a fertilized egg.\n\nOvulation\nBy definition, ovulation is the process of an ovary releasing an egg from the follicle - permitting the egg to float down the fallopian tubes. On average, the first phase of the menstrual cycle last two weeks. Directly prior to ovulation, another hormonal change takes place - the LH Surge. LH (or Luteinizing Hormone) is the hormone that actually facilitates ovulation: it causes the egg to separate from the ovarian surface. Ovulation predictor tests function by detecting this LH Surge, thus alerting the woman that ovulation is about to take place.\n\nOnce released from the ovaries (post-ovulation), the egg can survive for about 24 hours. This means that sperm (which can live several days) must be present to fertilize the egg. Following ovulation, the egg enters the fallopian tubes and continues toward the womb. Typically, conception - the uniting of the egg and the sperm - will take place in the fallopian tube, and then the fertilized egg will continue its passage to the uterus and implant in the uterine wall. For pregnancy to take place, fertilization of the egg must be followed by a successful implantation.\n\nFollowing ovulation, the luteal phase begins, marked by an increase of the hormone progesterone, which strengthens the uterine lining (endometrium) and causes the body temperature to increase, facilitates changes in the cervical fluid, and alters the position of the cervix.\n\nWithin 24 hours, if the egg has not been fertilized, it will simply disintegrate after reaching the uterus.

It was also used as a conditioner in bread and in the red food dye that was used in hot dogs.

As CNV progresses, the abnormal vessels may leak fluid and bleed.  Eventually this process causes damage to the overlying retina. Decreased and/or distorted vision will often occur. As for the cause in a newborn, I would guess that it would be an inherited eye disease.", "doctor_answer": "I think that you mean CMV, cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus related to the herpes virus group of infections. Like herpes, it is inactive at times, but it is incurable and is a life-time infection. CMV may be passed from a mother to her baby during pregnancy and is the most common congenital viral infection. It is also called congenital cytomegalovirus or cytomegalovirus inclusion disease. CMV without symptoms is common in babies and young children. It is found in saliva, urine, semen, and other body fluids. The virus is easily spread in households and in daycare centers. It can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy and to the baby during delivery or in breast milk.\n\nOver half of women of childbearing age become infected with CMV at least six months before becoming pregnant. There appear to be few risks for complications of CMV for this group and only a few babies have the infection at birth. These babies appear to have no significant illness or abnormalities.\n\nAbout 90 percent of babies who are infected with CMV have no symptoms at birth. But as many as 15 percent of these babies develop one or more neurological abnormalities — such as mental retardation, learning disabilities, hearing or vision loss — usually in the first year or two of life. Congenital CMV infection is a leading cause of hearing loss in children.\n\nAbout one in 1,000 babies (about 4,000 babies each year) shows symptoms of CMV at birth. These symptoms may include an enlarged spleen or liver, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and a distinctive rash. Up to 20 percent of these babies die, and about 90 percent of the survivors suffer from serious neurological defects, such as mental retardation.\n\nAt present there is no treatment that can halt or reverse the effects of congenital CMV. However, doctors are investigating whether a new antiviral drug called ganciclovir — which is used to treat adults with AIDS who have CMV-related eye infections — also may help babies with congenital CMV."}, {"question": "i have severe congestion in my head what is a safe medicine to take?", "patient_answer": "If you are concered about safety there are several non-drug therapies you can try.

Although the typical facial features may not be as apparent during the newborn period, they become more prominent as the infant develops. As these children grow into young adulthood, however, the facial abnormalities become more subtle and thereby contribute to the difficulty of recognizing FAS in older persons. With these physical abnormalities come sensory deficits that frequently involve vision, hearing and speech.

Only people with intimate contact with birds, in Asia the poor live with chickens in their houses, have gotten it. It is very difficult to spread through the air and it doesn't pass from human to human.

Addiction is defined as the compulsive need for and use of something that is psychologically or physically habit-forming, characterized by tolerance and by well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal; Being abnormally tolerant to and dependent upon a habit forming substance (such as the endorphins caused by throwing up, or the habit forming behavior of bingeing and the fear of gaining weight that leads to purging/laxatives/exercise in bulimia).\n\nWhat matters most is whether or not the substance or behavior causes what we now know to be the essence of addiction: uncontrollable, compulsive drug craving, seeking, and use, even in the face of negative health and social consequences.\n\nAddicts are trapped in their behaviors and cannot simply quit on their own. They have an illness that requires biomedical treatment. People often assume that because addiction begins with a voluntary behavior and is expressed in the form of excess behavior, an addict should just be able to quit by force of will alone. However, it is essential to understand when dealing with addicts that we are dealing with individuals whose brains have been altered by alcohol, drug or behavioral abuse. They need addiction treatment.\n\nToday, scientists and physicians overwhelmingly agree that while use and even abuse of drugs such as alcohol and cocaine is a behavior over which the individual exerts control, addiction to these substances is something different. Scientists have begun to understand why addicted people may sacrifice everything that's important to them -- their jobs, their families, their homes -- in the quest for a fix.\n\nBest,\n\n`k.", "doctor_answer": "I happen to agree with your friend.

Chiropractic uses a non invasive procedure to remove that nerve interference and permit the body to function in harmony without obstruction.. Chiropractic is proven and documented by peer reviewed journals to be effective with patients that have headaches..

It is most obvious in the skin; however, the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory, renal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems, as well as numerous vascular structures, are involved frequently. The symptoms result from progressive tissue fibrosis and occlusion of the microvasculature by excessive production and deposition of types I and III collagens. Other macromolecules found in the connective tissue (eg, glycosaminoglycans, tenascin, fibronectin) also are increased. The vascular alterations show a predilection for affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. The small vessel cytoskeleton is affected by structural defects that lead to collapse. Next, the tight junctions become altered and are no longer functional, allowing the endothelium to slip into the vessel lumen.\n\nFrom webmd:  Scleroderma (pronounced SKLEER-oh-der-ma) is Greek for hard skin. It's classified as both a connective-tissue disorder and a rheumatic condition. In scleroderma, the skin gradually tightens and thickens or hardens. It loses its ability to stretch. Tiny blood vessels throughout the body also may be affected, causing widespread damage to the internal organs.", "doctor_answer": "yes.\nscleroderma.\nwhy?"}, {"question": "How would you know the difference between Pagets breast cancer & eczema?", "patient_answer": "Go see a good oncological surgeon or skin doctor and have that looked at. While this implies it is not Pagets since you state that it is above the nipple. \n\nHowever be safe for see a doctor and get it checked. This is not something to wait on. \n\n\nPAGET'S DISEASE:\n\nIntroduction:\nPaget's disease of the breast is a rare form of breast cancer in which the first clinical finding is usually scaling of the nipple skin. It may also be associated with nipple redness and burning. The diagnosis of this condition is typically made with a skin biopsy, which shows cells typical of this condition (Paget's cells). The \"good news\" about Paget's disease is that it is usually a \"curable cancer\". However, most cases of scaling and burning of the nipple are due to benign conditions which can be easily confused with Paget's disease.\n\nMaking the Diagnosis:\nThe major goal of this section is to help women (and their physicians) detect the early nipple changes associated with Paget's disease, and to help differentiate them from benign conditions. Making the diagnosis of Paget's disease is actually quite easy. We use a simple skin punch biopsy technique to remove a small piece of tissue from the area of the nipple with the abnormal changes. This procedure takes a few minutes to perform under local anesthesia and is painless. A small amount of skin and underlying tissues is removed and sent to the pathologist. In our experience with hundreds of cases it has proven to be 100% accurate. \n\nThe first step in evaluating any patient with a change in the skin of the nipple is to obtain a careful history and to perform a careful breast examination, followed by a diagnostic mammogram. When performing a diagnostic mammogram the mammographer is informed about the posibility Paget's disease. Special films look for fine calcifications behind the nipple. If the mammogram is negative and our clinical suspicion is low, we usually suggest that the patient place a cortisone cream on the nipple for two weeks. \n\nIf the condition has not responded completely to treatment in two weeks, we proceed to a skin punch biopsy. (a word of caution: we have seen cases of Paget's disease in which the mammogram was negative. The patient seemed to respond to treatment, but nipple changes recurred again in a few months. Therefore if a biopsy is not done, careful follow-up is recommended). Our rule of thumb: if in doubt, do a skin biopsy.", "doctor_answer": "Sometimes you can't just by examining it.

It's not only the basic chemical half-life clock which determines mandatory nicotine feeding times, when quitting it's also the clock that determines how long it takes before the brain begins bathing in nicotine free blood-serum, the moment that real healing begins. \n\nIt can take up to 72 hours for the blood-serum to become nicotine-free and 90% of nicotine's metabolites to exit the body via your urine. It's then that the anxieties associated with readjustment normally peak in intensity and begin to gradually decline. \n\nBut just one powerful \"hit\" of nicotine and you’ll again face another 72 hours of detox anxieties. It's why the one puff survival rate is almost zero. None of us are stronger than nicotine but then we don’t need to be as it is simply a chemical with an I.Q. of zero. It does not plot, plan or conspire and is not some demon within us. Our most effective weapon against it is, and always has been, our vastly superior intelligence but only if put to work. \n\nNicotine Replacement Products\n\nThe key to nicotine dependency recovery is not in dragging out the 72 hours of detox by toying for weeks or months with gradual nicotine weaning or other creative means for delivering nicotine. The nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) industry want smokers to believe that a natural poison is medicine, that its use is therapy, and that it is somehow different from the tobacco plant's nicotine molecule. The truth is that the pharmaceutical industry buys its nicotiana from the exact same growers as the tobacco industry. They want you to believe that double-blind placebo controlled studies proved that NRT doubles a cold turkey quitters odds of quitting and that only superheros can quit without it. The truth is that their studies were not blind as claimed, and that all but a tiny sliver of earth's successful quitters are quitting entirely on their own. Here are a few facts that those selling creative nicotine delivery devices would rather you not know: \n\nNicotine is a psychoactive drug whose \"high\" provides a dopamine \"aaahhh\" sensation and an adrenaline rush. Would you have been able to tell, within 5 minutes, whether the gum or lozenge you'd been given contained the nicotine equilivent of smoking two cigarettes or was instead a nicotine-free placebo? So could they. A 2004 study found that NRT studies suffered from massive wide-spread blinding failures (May 2004) \nA nicotine smoker's natural odds of quitting for six months, entirely on their own, without any products, procedures, education programs, counseling or formal support is roughly 10% (June 2000) \nThose using the over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine patch or gum as a stand-alone quitting tool have only a 7% chance of quitting smoking for six months (March 2003) \nUp to 7% of OTC nicotine gum quitters are still chronic users of nicotine gum at six months (May 2004).

Anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen can be an enormous help.  Unfortunately, oral administration distributes the drug to the whole body, and the place where you need it can be under-treated.  Plus, ibuprofen and aspirin can cause stomach problems if you start raising the dosage.  \n\nThere is a solution- topical administration.  Ask your doctor for a prescription for ibuprofen cream.  It is usually called something else, like ketoprofen, and can be made with a topical pain-reliever such as bupivicane (like lidocaine).  Keep in mind your doctor may not have heard of it, and that it has to be compounded.  Check your phonebook for local compounding pharmacies so that you can give your doctor their phone number. Typically the cream comes as 10-20% active, which is possible because it will never be in your stomach to cause problems.  Unfortunately, because it has to be compounded, your insurance company will probably not cover it in the same way as regular drugs.  You may be looking at paying $50 for a 4oz jar. \n\nWhen you apply- be sure to really rub and massage the cream into your hands hard for 5-10 minutes.  This will help just as much as the ibuprofen will, because the muscle work will greatly increase blood flow to the area.  Together, massage and anti-inflammatory therapy can provide great relief.\n\nResults vary with patient.

Humans can contract the disease through close contact with infected birds, or with the feces of infected birds. It is not known to spread through human-to-human contact. There has been no indication that humans would get the disease through eating eggs or meat of sick birds.\n\nThe only known way to eradicate the disease is by culling infected flocks. Thus far millions of chickens, ducks and other kinds of poultry have been culled in an effort to eliminate the virus.

However, weight loss during breastfeeding is possible (living proof!).  The best way to go is to reduce the number of calories you eat and increase your exercise (I know, it's not as fun as taking a diet pill, but it lasts longer!).  While breastfeeding, your body uses about 500 calories a day to make milk for baby.  The most important thing for you is to make sure the foods you are eating are 80-90 % healthy (like during pregnancy).  If you eat junk, your baby will still get good milk, but your body will suffer because you will not get the vitamens and minerals you need.

This is where fresh oxygenated blood is pumped out to the entire body.  There are a variety of diseases that can require replacement of this valve, including aortic stenosis where the valve does not properly open and close, or an aortic insufficiency where the valve allows backflow of blood from the aorta back into the left ventricle of the heart.\n\nThere are two major types of aortic valve replacements - mechanical valves and biologic/tissue valves.  Mechanical valves have been around longer and subsequently have a very refined safety and efficacy profile.  The downside is that after the procedure, the patient must be put on blood thinners for the rest of their life.  Biologic/tissue valves do not need subsequent blood thinner treatment and therefore may benefit younger, generally healthy patients.  However, it has been shown that the durability of tissue valves may be lower than mechanical valves, which may require a repeat operation later in life.\n\nThere is a variation to the above procedures called the Ross procedure.  This procedure replaces the faulty aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve.  The pulmonary valve is then replaced with a tissue valve.  The rationale for doing this is that more strain is put on the aortic valve and therefore having the person's own anatomy in that place is preferable to having a weaker mechanical or tissue valve.  The pulmonary valve, which only pumps to the lungs (and therefore doesn't have to pump as hard) can withstand having a tissue valve, which isn't as durable.  In addition, this approach does not require blood thinners after the operation.\n\nCurrent cardiac surgery research is trying to investigate if valve replacement can be done in a minimally invasive way using catheter devices."}, {"question": "how can you releive sciatic pain?", "patient_answer": "Manual treatments for sciatica, including physical therapy and specific stretching and strengthening exercises, and manual manipulation (e.g. osteopathic or chiropractic manipulation) to help relieve the pressure on the nerve root, which is the cause of the pain.

Surgery for sciatica, such as microdiscectomy or lumbar laminectomy and discectomy, to remove the portion of the disc that is irritating the nerve root.

The difference in the teas lies in how the teas are prepared after picking. Black and oolong tea are fermented, but Green tea is not. Therefore the active constituents remain unaltered in green tea. The most important ingredient in green tea is the phytonutrient eppigallocatchin or EGCG for short. This substance is a polyphenolic compound that acts as an antioxidant.\n\nWhat does EGCG do?\nResearch has shown that these polyphenolic antioxidants protects the body against cardiovascular disease, and promote a healthy immune system. However in this new research, Professor Roger Thornley in England states, “We have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme DHFR or dihydrofolate which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs.

Kidney stones form in urine in the kidneys (redundant, I know, but hang in there).  They are most commonly calcium oxalate (but calcium doesn't cause the stones!).  In order for them to be passed without surgery, they have to go through the ureters to the urine bladder, and then through the urethra to exit the body.\n\nGallstones are formed in the gall bladder which stores bile created by the liver.  They are most commonly formed of cholesterol.  The gall bladder pumps bile into the top of the small intestine, where it helps digest fats and fat soluble vitamins.  And here's the big difference.  If a gallstone actually makes it out of the gallbladder, it will enter the small intestines and leave the body in feces.  \n\nThe bile duct, btw, is normally about 4mm but may go up to 7mm if there are lodged stones.  \n\nNow consider what someone who is claiming that their solution will allow gallstones to pass the body (with pictures!) is supposedly doing to find these gallstones.\n\n(And because I can't resist a good line)  If you pee it out, it's a kidney stone, if you poop it out it's a gallstone.\n\n\nNow, having said all of that, I see that the Mayo clinic does have a sound wave treatment for gallstones, but they indicate that it is appropriate for only a small number of cases.  And that the gallstones will come back on you unless you take a special medicine for the rest of your life.\n\nYou can try to control your gallstones by eating a very low fat, cholesterol controlling diet.  This might keep the stones from getting larger.  However, you will need to keep an eye on them, as they can get large enough to cause more serious problems than pain.", "doctor_answer": "I am givig you a link for a site that will answer you question and many more medical questions you may have.

Among various mycotoxins, aflatoxins have assumed significance due to their deleterious effects on human beings, poultry and livestock. The aflatoxin problem was first recognized in 1960, when there was severe outbreak of a disease referred as \"Turkey 'X' Disease\" in UK, in which over 100,000 turkey poults were died. The cause of the disease was shown due to toxins in peanut meal infected with Aspergillus flavus and the toxins were named as aflatoxins.\n\nNatural occurrence:\n\nFood products contaminated with aflatoxins include cereal (maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, wheat), oilseeds (groundnut, soybean, sunflower, cotton), spices (chillies, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, zinger), tree nuts (almonds, pistachio, walnuts, coconut) and milk. \n\nPhysical and chemical properties:\n\nAflatoxins are potent toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunosuppressive agents, produced as secondary metabolites by the fungus Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus on variety of food products. Among 18 different types of aflatoxins identified, major members are aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is normally predominant in amount in cultures as well as in food products. Pure AFB1 is pale-white to yellow crystalline, odorless solid. Aflatoxins are soluble in methanol, chloroform, actone, acetonitrile. A. flavus typically produces AFB1 and AFB2, where as A. parasiticus produce AFG1 and AFG2 as well as AFB1 and AFB2. Four other aflatoxins M1, M2, B2A, G2A which may be produced in minor amounts were subsequently isolated from cultures of A. flavus and A. parasiticus.

This is only for information.\n\nAcne Treatment\n\n|Self-Care at Home|\n\n    * Wash once or twice daily with soap and water to remove excess oil from the skin. An acne cleanser purchased over-the-counter in any drug store can also be helpful. Avoid scrubbing too abrasively because this can actually irritate the skin and cause acne to worsen.\n\n    * Over-the-counter acne medications can be used either at bedtime or during the day. Always follow the directions on any acne product.\n\n    * Many cover-up products are available without a prescription to improve the appearance of blemishes while they have a chance to heal. Most work well and should not worsen acne.\n\n    * Some cosmetics and other skin care products, however, can cause acne to worsen. Look for make-up, cosmetics, and skin care products labeled with the word noncomedogenic. This means that it does not cause or worsen acne.\n\n|Medical Treatment|\n\nMany treatment options are available to treat all forms of acne. Medications are the main treatment for acne and usually work well. Several preparations are available over-the-counter, while others require a prescription from a doctor.\n\n    * Over-the-counter medications: Nonprescription or over-the-counter medications for acne are plentiful and can be effective for milder forms of acne. They come in the form of soaps, washes, and cleansers.\n\n          o Many contain benzoyl peroxide, which does two things. First, benzoyl peroxide kills the acne-causing bacteria, which are thought to play a role in acne. Second, benzoyl peroxide can cause drying and flaking off of skin, which can help prevent the pores from becoming plugged. Plugged pores can develop into acne blemishes.\n\n          o Scrubbing excessively with any over-the-counter preparation can actually cause acne to worsen by additionally irritating the hair follicles.\n\n    * Prescription medications: Doctors can prescribe medications when acne becomes moderate to severe or is not controlled by over-the-counter medications. Prescription drugs can be used effectively alone or in combination with other prescription and nonprescription medications.\n\n          o Antibiotics: Antibiotics can be effective in treating most inflammatory acne (papules and pustules). They work by killing the bacteria and also by decreasing the redness and swelling seen in the inflammatory forms of acne.\n\n                + Antibiotics may be applied to the skin in the form of gels and lotions, or by way of pills. We now know that using a combination of 2 medications together may be very effective in treating acne. Using a topical antibiotic with topical benzoyl peroxide, for example, may prevent bacterial resistance to the antibiotic. Giving an antibiotic by mouth is often needed for acne that is more extensive, red, and tender.\n\n                + Antibiotics taken by mouth can be associated with more side effects than if applied to the skin and may interact with other medicines such as birth control pills. Sensitivity to the sun can result in a \"bad sunburn\" in some people who take the antibiotic tetracycline by mouth.\n\n          o Retinoids: Medicines made from vitamin A (retinoids) are useful in treating several types of acne lesions. Topical retinoids are effective in treating the noninflammatory types of acne (blackheads and whiteheads).\n\n                + Topical retinoids (applied directly to the skin) help to open clogged pores by creating a mild peeling effect. Drying of the skin can be a frequent side effect. Oral retinoids are reserved for treating the more extensive nodular type of acne or severe inflammatory acne, which has not responded to other treatments. Oral retinoids not only have a peeling effect but also decrease the production of oil.\n\n                + They can also be associated with a number of serious side effects including birth defects in babies of wome", "doctor_answer": "GET PROACTIVE--IT DOES WORK"}, {"question": "what is a pandemic opposed to an epidemic?", "patient_answer": "A pandemic is an epidemic occurring over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people.
